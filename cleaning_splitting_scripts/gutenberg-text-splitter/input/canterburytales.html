<p id="id00012">Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00013" style="margin-top: 2em">We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<p id="id00014">Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p id="id00016">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.</p>

<p id="id00017">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p id="id00018">At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>

<p id="id00035">*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.</p>

<p id="id00036">ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p id="id00037">To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p id="id00038">LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p id="id00039">If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

<p id="id00054" style="margin-top: 2em">Credits: This e-text was scanned, re-formatted and edited with
extra notes by Donal O' Danachair (kodak_seaside@hotmail.com).
I would like to acknowledge the help of Edwin Duncan, Juris
Lidaka and Aniina Jokinnen in identifying some of the poems no
Longer attributed to Chaucer.
This e-text, with its notes, is hereby placed in the public
domain.</p>

<p id="id00055">Preface: The preface is for a combined volume of poems by
Chaucer and Edmund Spenser.  The Spenser poems will shortly
be available as a separate E-text.</p>

<p id="id00056">Spelling and punctuation: These are the same as in the book as
far as possible.  Accents have been removed. Diereses (umlauts)
have been removed from English words and replaced by "e" in
German ones. The AE and OE digraphs have been transcribed
as two letters.  The British pound (currency) sign has been
replaced by a capital L. Greek words have been transliterated.</p>

<p id="id00057">Footnotes: The original book has an average of 30 footnotes
per page.  These were of three types:
(A) Glosses or explanations of obsolete words and phrases.
These have been treated as follows:
1. In the poems, they have been moved up into the right-hand
margin. Some of them have been shortened or paraphrased in
order to fit.
Explanations of single words have a single asterisk at the
end of the word and at the beginning of the explanation*.     *like this
If two words in the same line have explanations
the first* has one and the second**, two.          *like this **and this
Explanations of phrases have an asterisk at the
start and end *of the phrase* and of the explanation         *like this*
Sometimes these glosses wrap onto the next line, still in the
right margin. If you read this e-text using a monospaced font
(like Courier in a word processor such as MS Word, or the
default font in most text editors) then the marginal notes are
right-justified.
2. In the prose tales,  they have been imbedded into the text in
square brackets after the word or phrase they refer to [like this].
(B) Etymological explanations of these words.  These are
indicted by a number in angle brackets in the marginal
gloss.* The note will be found at the                     *like this &lt;1&gt;
end of the poem or section.
(C) Longer notes commenting on or explaining the text. These
are indicated in the text by numbers in angle brackets thus: &lt;1&gt;.
The note will be found at the end of the poem or section.</p>

<p id="id00058">Latin: Despite his declared aim of editing the tales "for popular
perusal", Purves has left nearly all Latin quotations
untranslated.  I have translated them as well as I could — any
errors are my fault, not his.</p>

<p id="id00063" style="margin-top: 2em">Transcriber's Note.</p>

<p id="id00064">1. Modern scholars believe that Chaucer was not the author of
these poems.</p>

<h3 id="id00065" style="margin-top: 3em">                            PREFACE.</h3>

<p id="id00066" style="margin-top: 2em">THE object of this volume is to place before the general reader
our two early poetic masterpieces — The Canterbury Tales and
The Faerie Queen; to do so in a way that will render their
"popular perusal" easy in a time of little leisure and unbounded
temptations to intellectual languor; and, on the same conditions,
to present a liberal and fairly representative selection from the
less important and familiar poems of Chaucer and Spenser.
There is, it may be said at the outset, peculiar advantage and
propriety in placing the two poets side by side in the manner
now attempted for the first time.  Although two centuries divide
them, yet Spenser is the direct and really the immediate
successor to the poetical inheritance of Chaucer.  Those two
hundred years, eventful as they were, produced no poet at all
worthy to take up the mantle that fell from Chaucer's shoulders;
and Spenser does not need his affected archaisms, nor his
frequent and reverent appeals to "Dan Geffrey," to vindicate for
himself a place very close to his great predecessor in the literary
history of England. If Chaucer is the "Well of English
undefiled," Spenser is the broad and stately river that yet holds
the tenure of its very life from the fountain far away in other
and ruder scenes.</p>

<p id="id00067">The Canterbury Tales, so far as they are in verse, have been
printed without any abridgement or designed change in the
sense.  But the two Tales in prose — Chaucer's Tale of
Meliboeus, and the Parson's long Sermon on Penitence — have
been contracted, so as to exclude thirty pages of unattractive
prose, and to admit the same amount of interesting and
characteristic poetry.  The gaps thus made in the prose Tales,
however, are supplied by careful outlines of the omitted matter,
so that the reader need be at no loss to comprehend the whole
scope and sequence of the original.  With The Faerie Queen a
bolder course has been pursued. The great obstacle to the
popularity of Spencer's splendid work has lain less in its
language than in its length.  If we add together the three great
poems of antiquity — the twenty-four books of the Iliad, the
twenty-four books of the Odyssey, and the twelve books of the
Aeneid — we get at the dimensions of only one-half of The
Faerie Queen.  The six books, and the fragment of a seventh,
which alone exist of the author's contemplated twelve, number
about 35,000 verses; the sixty books of Homer and Virgil
number no more than 37,000. The mere bulk of the poem, then,
has opposed a formidable barrier to its popularity; to say
nothing of the distracting effect produced by the numberless
episodes, the tedious narrations, and the constant repetitions,
which have largely swelled that bulk.  In this volume the poem
is compressed into two-thirds of its original space, through the
expedient of representing the less interesting and more
mechanical passages by a condensed prose outline, in which it
has been sought as far as possible to preserve the very words of
the poet.  While deprecating a too critical judgement on the
bare and constrained precis standing in such trying
juxtaposition, it is hoped that the labour bestowed in saving the
reader the trouble of wading through much that is not essential
for the enjoyment of Spencer's marvellous allegory, will not be
unappreciated.</p>

<p id="id00068">As regards the manner in which the text of the two great works,
especially of The Canterbury Tales, is presented, the Editor is
aware that some whose judgement is weighty will differ from
him.  This volume has been prepared "for popular perusal;" and
its very raison d'etre would have failed, if the ancient
orthography had been retained.  It has often been affirmed by
editors of Chaucer in the old forms of the language, that a little
trouble at first would render the antiquated spelling and
obsolete inflections a continual source, not of difficulty, but of
actual delight, for the reader coming to the study of Chaucer
without any preliminary acquaintance with the English of his
day — or of his copyists' days.  Despite this complacent
assurance, the obvious fact is, that Chaucer in the old forms has
not become popular, in the true sense of the word; he is not
"understanded of the vulgar."  In this volume, therefore, the text
of Chaucer has been presented in nineteenth-century garb.  But
there has been not the slightest attempt to "modernise"
Chaucer, in the wider meaning of the phrase; to replace his
words by words which he did not use; or, following the example
of some operators, to translate him into English of the modern
spirit as well as the modern forms.  So far from that, in every
case where the old spelling or form seemed essential to metre,
to rhyme, or meaning, no change has been attempted.  But,
wherever its preservation was not essential, the spelling of the
monkish transcribers — for the most ardent purist must now
despair of getting at the spelling of Chaucer himself — has been
discarded for that of the reader's own day.  It is a poor
compliment to the Father of English Poetry, to say that by such
treatment the bouquet and individuality of his works must be
lost.  If his masterpiece is valuable for one thing more than any
other, it is the vivid distinctness with which English men and
women of the fourteenth century are there painted, for the study
of all the centuries to follow.  But we wantonly balk the artist's
own purpose, and discredit his labour, when we keep before his
picture the screen of dust and cobwebs which, for the English
people in these days, the crude forms of the infant language
have practically become.  Shakespeare has not suffered by
similar changes; Spencer has not suffered; it would be surprising
if Chaucer should suffer, when the loss of popular
comprehension and favour in his case are necessarily all the
greater for his remoteness from our day.  In a much smaller
degree — since previous labours in the same direction had left
far less to do — the same work has been performed for the
spelling of Spenser; and the whole endeavour in this department
of the Editor's task has been, to present a text plain and easily
intelligible to the modern reader, without any injustice to the old
poet.  It would be presumptuous to believe that in every case
both ends have been achieved together; but the laudatores
temporis acti - the students who may differ most from the plan
pursued in this volume — will best appreciate the difficulty of
the enterprise, and most leniently regard any failure in the
details of its accomplishment.</p>

<p id="id00069">With all the works of Chaucer, outside The Canterbury Tales, it
would have been absolutely impossible to deal within the scope
of this volume.  But nearly one hundred pages, have been
devoted to his minor poems; and, by dint of careful selection
and judicious abridgement — a connecting outline of the story in
all such cases being given — the Editor ventures to hope that he
has presented fair and acceptable specimens of Chaucer's
workmanship in all styles.  The preparation of this part of the
volume has been a laborious task; no similar attempt on the
same scale has been made; and, while here also the truth of the
text in matters essential has been in nowise sacrificed to mere
ease of perusal, the general reader will find opened up for him a
new view of Chaucer and his works.  Before a perusal of these
hundred pages, will melt away for ever the lingering tradition or
prejudice that Chaucer was only, or characteristically, a coarse
buffoon, who pandered to a base and licentious appetite by
painting and exaggerating the lowest vices of his time.  In these
selections — made without a thought of taking only what is to
the poet's credit from a wide range of poems in which hardly a
word is to his discredit — we behold Chaucer as he was; a
courtier, a gallant, pure-hearted gentleman, a scholar, a
philosopher, a poet of gay and vivid fancy, playing around
themes of chivalric convention, of deep human interest, or
broad-sighted satire.  In The Canterbury Tales, we see, not
Chaucer, but Chaucer's times and neighbours; the artist has lost
himself in his work. To show him honestly and without disguise,
as he lived his own life and sung his own songs at the brilliant
Court of Edward III, is to do his memory a moral justice far
more material than any wrong that can ever come out of
spelling.  As to the minor poems of Spenser, which follow The
Faerie Queen, the choice has been governed by the desire to
give at once the most interesting, and the most characteristic of
the poet's several styles; and, save in the case of the Sonnets,
the poems so selected are given entire. It is manifest that the
endeavours to adapt this volume for popular use, have been
already noticed, would imperfectly succeed without the aid of
notes and glossary, to explain allusions that have become
obsolete, or antiquated words which it was necessary to retain.
An endeavour has been made to render each page self-
explanatory, by placing on it all the glossarial and illustrative
notes required for its elucidation, or — to avoid repetitions that
would have occupied space — the references to the spot where
information may be found.  The great advantage of such a plan
to the reader, is the measure of its difficulty for the editor.  It
permits much more flexibility in the choice of glossarial
explanations or equivalents; it saves the distracting and time-
consuming reference to the end or the beginning of the book;
but, at the same time, it largely enhances the liability to error.
The Editor is conscious that in the 12,000 or 13,000 notes, as
well as in the innumerable minute points of spelling,
accentuation, and rhythm, he must now and again be found
tripping; he can only ask any reader who may detect all that he
could himself point out as being amiss, to set off against
inevitable mistakes and misjudgements, the conscientious labour
bestowed on the book, and the broad consideration of its fitness
for the object contemplated.</p>

<p id="id00070"> From books the Editor has derived valuable help; as from Mr
Cowden Clarke's revised modern text of The Canterbury Tales,
published in Mr Nimmo's Library Edition of the English Poets;
from Mr Wright's scholarly edition of the same work; from the
indispensable Tyrwhitt; from Mr Bell's edition of Chaucer's
Poem; from Professor Craik's "Spenser and his Poetry,"
published twenty-five years ago by Charles Knight; and from
many others. In the abridgement of the Faerie Queen,  the plan
may at first sight seem to be modelled on the lines of Mr Craik's
painstaking condensation; but the coincidences are either
inevitable or involuntary.  Many of the notes, especially of those
explaining classical references and those attached to the minor
poems of Chaucer, have been prepared specially for this edition.
The Editor leaves his task with the hope that his attempt to
remove artificial obstacles to the popularity of  England's
earliest poets, will not altogether miscarry.</p>

<h3 id="id00072" style="margin-top: 3em">                    LIFE OF GEOFFREY CHAUCER.</h3>

<p id="id00073" style="margin-top: 2em">NOT in point of genius only, but even in point of time, Chaucer
may claim the proud designation of "first" English poet. He
wrote "The Court of Love" in 1345, and "The Romaunt of the
Rose," if not also "Troilus and Cressida," probably within the
next decade: the dates usually assigned to the poems of
Laurence Minot extend from 1335 to 1355, while "The Vision
of Piers Plowman" mentions events that occurred in 1360 and
1362 — before which date Chaucer had certainly written "The
Assembly of Fowls" and his "Dream." But, though they were
his contemporaries, neither Minot nor Langland (if Langland
was the author of the Vision) at all approached Chaucer in the
finish, the force, or the universal interest of their works and the
poems of earlier writer; as Layamon and the author of the
"Ormulum," are less English than Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-
Norman. Those poems reflected the perplexed struggle for
supremacy between the two grand elements of our language,
which marked the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; a struggle
intimately associated with the political relations between the
conquering Normans and the subjugated Anglo-Saxons.
Chaucer found two branches of the language; that spoken by
the people, Teutonic in its genius and its forms; that spoken by
the learned and the noble, based on the French  Yet each branch
had begun to borrow of the other — just as nobles and people
had been taught to recognise that each needed the other in the
wars and the social tasks of the time; and Chaucer, a scholar, a
courtier, a man conversant with all orders of society, but
accustomed to speak, think, and write in the words of the
highest, by his comprehensive genius cast into the simmering
mould a magical amalgamant which made the two half-hostile
elements unite and interpenetrate each other. Before Chaucer
wrote, there were two tongues in England, keeping alive the
feuds and resentments of cruel centuries; when he laid down his
pen, there was practically but one speech — there was, and ever
since has been, but one people.</p>

<p id="id00074">Geoffrey Chaucer, according to the most trustworthy traditions-
for authentic testimonies on the subject are wanting — was born
in 1328; and London is generally believed to have been his
birth-place. It is true that Leland, the biographer of England's
first great poet who lived nearest to his time, not merely speaks
of Chaucer as having been  born many years later than the date
now assigned, but mentions Berkshire or Oxfordshire as the
scene of his birth. So great uncertainty have some felt on the
latter score, that elaborate parallels have been drawn between
Chaucer, and Homer — for whose birthplace several cities
contended, and whose descent was traced to the demigods.
Leland may seem to have had fair opportunities of getting at the
truth about Chaucer's birth — for Henry VIII had him, at the
suppression of the monasteries throughout England, to search
for records of public interest the archives of the religious
houses. But it may be questioned whether he was likely to find
many authentic particulars regarding the personal history of the
poet in the quarters which he explored; and Leland's testimony
seems to be set aside by Chaucer's own evidence as to his
birthplace, and by the contemporary references which make him
out an aged man for years preceding the accepted date of his
death. In one of his prose works, "The Testament of Love," the
poet speaks of himself in terms that strongly confirm the claim
of London to the honour of giving him birth; for he there
mentions "the city of London, that is to me so dear and sweet,
in which I was forth growen; and more kindly love," says he,
"have I to that place than to any other in earth; as every kindly
creature hath full appetite to that place of his kindly engendrure,
and to will rest and peace in that place to abide." This tolerably
direct evidence is supported — so far as it can be at such an
interval of time — by the learned Camden; in his Annals of
Queen Elizabeth, he describes Spencer, who was certainly born
in London, as being a fellow-citizen of Chaucer's — "Edmundus
Spenserus, patria Londinensis, Musis adeo arridentibus natus, ut
omnes Anglicos superioris aevi poetas, ne Chaucero quidem
concive excepto, superaret." &lt;1&gt; The records of the time notice
more than one person of the name of Chaucer, who held
honourable positions about the Court; and though we cannot
distinctly trace the poet's relationship with any of these
namesakes or antecessors, we find excellent ground for belief
that his family or friends stood well at Court, in the ease with
which Chaucer made his way there, and in his subsequent
career.</p>

<p id="id00075">Like his great successor, Spencer, it was the fortune of Chaucer
to live under a splendid, chivalrous, and high-spirited reign.
1328 was the second year of Edward III; and, what with Scotch
wars, French expeditions, and the strenuous and costly struggle
to hold England in a worthy place among the States of Europe,
there was sufficient bustle, bold achievement, and high ambition
in the period to inspire a poet who was prepared to catch the
spirit of the day. It was an age of elaborate courtesy, of high-
paced gallantry, of courageous venture, of noble disdain for
mean tranquillity; and Chaucer, on the whole a man of peaceful
avocations, was penetrated to the depth of his consciousness
with the lofty and lovely civil side of that brilliant and restless
military period. No record of his youthful years, however,
remains to us; if we believe that at the age of eighteen he was a
student of Cambridge, it is only on the strength of a reference in
his "Court of Love", where the narrator is made to say that his
name is Philogenet, "of Cambridge clerk;" while he had  already
told us that when he was stirred to seek the Court of Cupid he
was "at eighteen year of age." According to Leland, however,
he was educated at Oxford, proceeding thence to France and
the Netherlands, to finish his studies; but there remains no
certain evidence of his having belonged to either University. At
the same time, it is not doubted that his family was of good
condition; and, whether or not we accept the assertion that his
father held the rank of knighthood — rejecting the hypotheses
that make him a merchant, or a vintner "at the corner of Kirton
Lane" — it is plain, from Chaucer's whole career, that he had
introductions to public life, and recommendations to courtly
favour, wholly independent of his genius. We have the clearest
testimony that his mental training was of wide range and
thorough excellence, altogether rare for a mere courtier in those
days: his poems attest his intimate acquaintance with the
divinity, the philosophy, and the scholarship of his time, and
show him to have had the sciences, as then developed and
taught, "at his fingers' ends." Another proof of Chaucer's good
birth and fortune would he found in the statement that, after his
University career was completed, he entered the Inner Temple -
- the expenses of which could be borne only by men of noble
and opulent families; but although there is a story that he was
once fined two shillings for thrashing a Franciscan friar in Fleet
Street, we have no direct authority for believing that the poet
devoted himself to the uncongenial study of the law. No special
display of knowledge on that subject appears in his works; yet
in the sketch of the Manciple, in the Prologue to the Canterbury
Tales, may be found indications of his familiarity with the
internal economy of the Inns of Court; while numerous legal
phrases and references hint that his comprehensive information
was not at fault on legal matters. Leland says that he quitted the
University "a ready logician, a smooth rhetorician, a pleasant
poet, a grave philosopher, an ingenious mathematician, and a
holy divine;" and by all accounts, when Geoffrey Chaucer
comes before us authentically for the first time, at the age of
thirty-one, he was possessed of knowledge and
accomplishments far beyond the common standard of his day.</p>

<p id="id00076">Chaucer at this period possessed also other qualities fitted to
recommend him to favour in a Court like that of Edward III.
Urry describes him, on the authority of a portrait, as being then
"of a fair beautiful complexion, his lips red and full, his size of a
just medium, and his port and air graceful and majestic. So,"
continues the ardent biographer, — "so that every ornament that
could claim the approbation of the great and fair, his abilities to
record the valour of the one, and celebrate the beauty of the
other, and his wit and gentle behaviour to converse with both,
conspired to make him a complete courtier."  If we believe that
his "Court of Love" had received such publicity as the literary
media of the time allowed in the somewhat narrow and select
literary world — not to speak of "Troilus and Cressida," which,
as Lydgate mentions it first among Chaucer's works, some have
supposed to be a youthful production — we find a third and not
less powerful recommendation to the favour of the great co-
operating with his learning and his gallant bearing. Elsewhere
&lt;2&gt; reasons have been shown for doubt whether "Troilus and
Cressida" should not be assigned to a later period of Chaucer's
life; but very little is positively known about the dates and
sequence of his various works. In the year 1386, being called as
witness with regard to a contest on a point of heraldry between
Lord Scrope and Sir Robert Grosvenor, Chaucer deposed that
he entered on his military career in 1359. In that year Edward
III invaded France, for the third time, in pursuit of his claim to
the French crown; and we may fancy that, in describing the
embarkation of the knights in "Chaucer's Dream", the poet
gained some of the vividness and stir of his picture from his
recollections of the embarkation of the splendid and well-
appointed royal host at Sandwich, on board the eleven hundred
transports provided for the enterprise. In this expedition the
laurels of Poitiers were flung on the ground; after vainly
attempting Rheims and Paris, Edward was constrained, by cruel
weather and lack of provisions, to retreat toward his ships; the
fury of the elements made the retreat more disastrous than an
overthrow in pitched battle; horses and men perished by
thousands, or fell into the hands of the pursuing French.
Chaucer, who had been made prisoner at the siege of Retters,
was among the captives in the possession of France when the
treaty of Bretigny — the "great peace" — was concluded, in
May, 1360. Returning to England, as we may suppose, at the
peace, the poet, ere long, fell into another and a pleasanter
captivity; for his marriage is generally believed to have taken
place shortly after his release from foreign durance.  He had
already gained the personal friendship and favour of John of
Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the King's son; the Duke, while Earl
of Richmond, had courted, and won to wife after a certain
delay, Blanche, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Duke of
Lancaster; and Chaucer is by some believed to have written
"The Assembly of Fowls" to celebrate the wooing, as he wrote
"Chaucer's Dream" to celebrate the wedding, of his patron. The
marriage took place in 1359, the year of Chaucer's expedition to
France; and as, in "The Assembly of Fowls," the formel or
female eagle, who is supposed to represent the Lady Blanche,
begs that her choice of a mate may be deferred for a year, 1358
and 1359 have been assigned as the respective dates of the two
poems already mentioned.  In the "Dream," Chaucer
prominently introduces his own lady-love, to whom, after the
happy union of his patron with the Lady Blanche, he is wedded
amid great rejoicing; and various expressions in the same poem
show that not only was the poet high in favour with the
illustrious pair, but that his future wife had also peculiar claims
on their regard.  She was the younger daughter of Sir Payne
Roet, a native of Hainault, who had, like many of his
countrymen, been attracted to England by the example and
patronage of Queen Philippa. The favourite attendant on the
Lady Blanche was her elder sister Katherine: subsequently
married to Sir Hugh Swynford, a gentleman of Lincolnshire;
and destined, after the death of Blanche, to be in succession
governess of her children, mistress of John of Gaunt, and
lawfully-wedded Duchess of Lancaster. It is quite sufficient
proof that Chaucer's position at Court was of no mean
consequence, to find that his wife, the sister of the future
Duchess of Lancaster, was one of the royal maids of honour,
and even, as Sir Harris Nicolas conjectures, a god-daughter of
the Queen — for her name also was Philippa.</p>

<p id="id00077">Between 1359, when the poet himself testifies that he was made
prisoner while bearing arms in France, and September 1366,
when Queen Philippa granted to her former maid of honour, by
the name of Philippa Chaucer, a yearly pension of ten marks, or
L6, 13s. 4d., we have no authentic mention of Chaucer, express
or indirect. It is plain from this grant that the poet's marriage
with Sir Payne Roet's daughter was not celebrated later than
1366; the probability is, that it closely followed his return from
the wars. In 1367, Edward III. settled upon Chaucer a life-
pension of twenty marks, "for the good service which our
beloved Valet — 'dilectus Valettus noster' — Geoffrey Chaucer
has rendered, and will render in time to come." Camden
explains 'Valettus hospitii' to signify a Gentleman of the Privy
Chamber; Selden says that the designation was bestowed "upon
young heirs designed to he knighted, or young gentlemen of
great descent and quality." Whatever the strict meaning of the
word, it is plain that the poet's position was honourable and
near to the King's person, and also that his worldly
circumstances were easy, if not affluent — for it need not be said
that twenty marks in those days represented twelve or twenty
times the sum in these.  It is believed that he found powerful
patronage, not merely from the Duke of Lancaster and his wife,
but from Margaret Countess of Pembroke, the King's daughter.
To her Chaucer is supposed to have addressed the "Goodly
Ballad", in which the lady is celebrated under the image of the
daisy; her he is by some understood to have represented under
the title of Queen Alcestis, in the "Court of Love" and the
Prologue to "The Legend of Good Women;" and in her praise
we may read his charming descriptions and eulogies of the daisy
— French, "Marguerite," the name of his Royal patroness. To
this period of Chaucer's career we may probably attribute the
elegant and courtly, if somewhat conventional, poems of "The
Flower and the Leaf," "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale," &amp;c.
"The Lady Margaret," says Urry, ". . . would frequently
compliment him upon his poems. But this is not to be meant of
his Canterbury Tales, they being written in the latter part of his
life, when the courtier and the fine gentleman gave way to solid
sense and plain descriptions. In his love-pieces he was obliged
to have the strictest regard to modesty and decency; the ladies
at that time insisting so much upon the nicest punctilios of
honour, that it was highly criminal to depreciate their sex, or do
anything that might offend virtue." Chaucer, in their estimation,
had sinned against the dignity and honour of womankind by his
translation of the French "Roman de la Rose," and by his
"Troilus and Cressida" — assuming it to have been among his
less mature works; and to atone for those offences the Lady
Margaret (though other and older accounts say that it was the
first Queen of Richard II., Anne of Bohemia), prescribed to him
the task of writing "The Legend of Good Women" (see
introductory note to that poem). About this period, too, we
may place the composition of Chaucer's A. B. C., or The Prayer
of Our Lady, made at the request of the Duchess Blanche, a
lady of great devoutness in her private life. She died in 1369;
and Chaucer, as he had allegorised her wooing, celebrated her
marriage, and aided her devotions, now lamented her death, in a
poem entitled "The Book of the Duchess; or, the Death of
Blanche.&lt;3&gt;</p>

<p id="id00078">In 1370, Chaucer was employed on the King's service abroad;
and in November 1372, by the title of "Scutifer noster" — our
Esquire or Shield-bearer — he was associated with "Jacobus
Pronan," and "Johannes de Mari civis Januensis," in a royal
commission, bestowing full powers to treat with the Duke of
Genoa, his Council, and State.  The object of the embassy was
to negotiate upon the choice of an English port at which the
Genoese might form a commercial establishment; and Chaucer,
having quitted England in December, visited Genoa and
Florence, and returned to England before the end of November
1373 — for on that day he drew his pension from the Exchequer
in person. The most interesting point connected with this Italian
mission is the question, whether Chaucer visited Petrarch at
Padua. That he did, is unhesitatingly affirmed by the old
biographers; but the authentic notices of Chaucer during the
years 1372-1373, as shown by the researches of Sir Harris
Nicolas, are confined to the facts already stated; and we are left
to answer the question by the probabilities of the case, and by
the aid of what faint light the poet himself affords. We can
scarcely fancy that Chaucer, visiting Italy for the first time, in a
capacity which opened for him easy access to the great and the
famous, did not embrace the chance of meeting a poet whose
works he evidently knew in their native tongue, and highly
esteemed.  With Mr Wright, we are strongly disinclined to
believe "that Chaucer did not profit by the opportunity . . . of
improving his acquaintance with the poetry, if not the poets, of
the country he thus visited, whose influence was now being felt
on the literature of most countries of Western Europe." That
Chaucer was familiar with the Italian language appears not
merely from his repeated selection as Envoy to Italian States,
but by many passages in his poetry, from "The Assembly of
Fowls" to "The Canterbury Tales." In the opening of the first
poem  there is a striking parallel to Dante's inscription on the
gate of Hell.  The first Song of Troilus, in "Troilus and
Cressida", is a nearly literal translation of Petrarch's 88th
Sonnet. In the Prologue to "The Legend of Good Women",
there is a reference to Dante which can hardly have reached the
poet at second- hand. And in Chaucer's great work — as in The
Wife of Bath's Tale, and The Monk's Tale  — direct reference by
name is made to Dante, "the wise poet of Florence," "the great
poet of Italy," as the source whence the author has quoted.
When we consider the poet's high place in literature and at
Court, which could not fail to make him free of the hospitalities
of the brilliant little Lombard States; his familiarity with the
tongue and the works of Italy's greatest bards, dead and living;
the reverential regard which he paid to the memory of great
poets, of which we have examples in "The House of Fame," and
at the close of "Troilus and Cressida" &lt;4&gt;; along with his own
testimony in the Prologue to The Clerk's Tale, we cannot fail to
construe that testimony as a declaration that the Tale was
actually told to Chaucer by the lips of Petrarch, in 1373, the
very year in which Petrarch translated it into Latin, from
Boccaccio's "Decameron."&lt;5&gt;   Mr Bell notes the objection to
this interpretation, that the words are put into the mouth, not of
the poet, but of the Clerk; and meets it by the counter-
objection, that the Clerk, being a purely imaginary personage,
could not have learned the story at Padua from Petrarch — and
therefore that Chaucer must have departed from the dramatic
assumption maintained in the rest of the dialogue. Instances
could be adduced from Chaucer's writings to show that such a
sudden "departure from the dramatic assumption" would not be
unexampled: witness the "aside" in The Wife of Bath's
Prologue, where, after the jolly Dame has asserted that "half so
boldly there can no man swear and lie as a woman can", the
poet hastens to interpose, in his own person, these two lines:</p>

<p id="id00079">"I say not this by wives that be wise,<br>

But if it be when they them misadvise."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00080">And again, in the Prologue to the "Legend of Good Women,"
from a description of the daisy —</p>

<p id="id00081">"She is the clearness and the very light,<br>

That in this darke world me guides and leads,"<br>
</p>

<p id="id00082">the poet, in the very next lines, slides into an address to his lady:</p>

<p id="id00083">"The heart within my sorrowful heart you dreads<br>

And loves so sore, that ye be, verily,<br>

The mistress of my wit, and nothing I," &amp;c.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00084">When, therefore, the Clerk of Oxford is made to say that he will
tell a tale —</p>

<p id="id00085">                          "The which that I<br>

Learn'd at Padova of a worthy clerk,<br>

As proved by his wordes and his werk.<br>

He is now dead, and nailed in his chest,<br>

I pray to God to give his soul good rest.<br>

Francis Petrarc', the laureate poete,<br>

Highte this clerk, whose rhetoric so sweet<br>

Illumin'd all Itaile of poetry. . . .<br>

But forth to tellen of this worthy man,<br>

That taughte me this tale, as I began." . . .<br>
</p>

<p id="id00086">we may without violent effort believe that Chaucer speaks in his
own person, though dramatically the words are on the Clerk's
lips.  And the belief is not impaired by the sorrowful way in
which the Clerk lingers on Petrarch's death — which would be
less intelligible if the fictitious narrator had only read the story
in the Latin translation, than if we suppose the news of
Petrarch's death at Arqua in July 1374 to have closely followed
Chaucer to England, and to have cruelly and irresistibly mingled
itself with our poet's personal recollections of his great Italian
contemporary.  Nor must we regard as without significance the
manner in which the Clerk is made to distinguish between the
"body" of Petrarch's tale, and the fashion in which it was set
forth in writing, with a proem that seemed "a thing
impertinent", save that the poet had chosen in that way to
"convey his matter" — told, or "taught," so much more directly
and simply by word of mouth. It is impossible to pronounce
positively on the subject; the question whether Chaucer saw
Petrarch in 1373 must remain a moot-point, so long as we have
only our present information; but fancy loves to dwell on the
thought of the two poets conversing under the vines at Arqua;
and we find in the history and the writings of Chaucer nothing
to contradict, a good deal to countenance, the belief that such a
meeting occurred.</p>

<p id="id00087">Though we have no express record, we have indirect testimony,
that Chaucer's Genoese mission was discharged satisfactorily;
for on the 23d of April 1374, Edward III grants at Windsor to
the poet, by the title of "our beloved squire" — dilecto Armigero
nostro — unum pycher. vini, "one pitcher of wine" daily, to be
"perceived" in the port of London; a grant which, on the
analogy of more modern usage, might he held equivalent to
Chaucer's appointment as Poet Laureate. When we find that
soon afterwards the grant was commuted for a money payment
of twenty marks per annum, we need not conclude that
Chaucer's circumstances were poor; for it may be easily
supposed that the daily "perception" of such an article of
income was attended with considerable prosaic inconvenience.
A permanent provision for Chaucer was made on the 8th of
June 1374, when he was appointed Controller of the Customs in
the Port of London, for the lucrative imports of wools, skins or
"wool-fells," and tanned hides — on condition that he should
fulfil the duties of that office in person and not by deputy, and
should write out the accounts with his own hand.  We have
what seems evidence of Chaucer's compliance with these terms
in "The House of Fame", where, in the mouth of the eagle, the
poet describes himself, when he has finished his labour and
made his reckonings, as not seeking rest and news in social
intercourse, but going home to his own house, and there, "all so
dumb as any stone," sitting "at another book," until his look is
dazed; and again, in the record that in 1376 he received a grant
of L731, 4s. 6d., the amount of a fine levied on one John Kent,
whom Chaucer's vigilance had frustrated in the attempt to ship a
quantity of wool for Dordrecht without paying the duty. The
seemingly derogatory condition, that the Controller should
write out the accounts or rolls ("rotulos") of his office with his
own hand, appears to have been designed, or treated, as merely
formal; no records in Chaucer's handwriting are known to exist
— which could hardly be the case if, for the twelve years of his
Controllership (1374-1386), he had duly complied with the
condition; and during that period he was more than once
employed abroad, so that the condition was evidently regarded
as a formality even by those who had imposed it.  Also in 1374,
the Duke of Lancaster, whose ambitious views may well have
made him anxious to retain the adhesion of a man so capable
and accomplished as Chaucer, changed into a joint life-annuity
remaining to the survivor, and charged on the revenues of the
Savoy, a pension of L10 which two years before he settled on
the poet's wife — whose sister was then the governess of the
Duke's two daughters, Philippa and Elizabeth, and the Duke's
own mistress.  Another proof of Chaucer's personal reputation
and high Court favour at this time, is his selection (1375) as
ward to the son of Sir Edmond Staplegate of Bilsynton, in Kent;
a charge on the surrender of which the guardian received no
less a sum than L104.</p>

<p id="id00088">We find Chaucer in 1376 again employed on a foreign mission.
In 1377, the last year of Edward III., he was sent to Flanders
with Sir Thomas Percy, afterwards Earl of Worcester, for the
purpose of obtaining a prolongation of the truce; and in January
13738, he was associated with Sir Guichard d'Angle and other
Commissioners, to pursue certain negotiations for a marriage
between Princess Mary of France and the young King Richard
II., which had been set on foot before the death of Edward III.
The negotiation, however, proved fruitless; and in May 1378,
Chaucer was selected to accompany Sir John Berkeley on a
mission to the Court of Bernardo Visconti, Duke of Milan, with
the view, it is supposed, of concerting military plans against the
outbreak of war with France.  The new King, meantime, had
shown that he was not insensible to Chaucer's merit  — or to the
influence of his tutor and the poet's patron, the Duke of
Lancaster; for Richard II. confirmed to Chaucer his pension of
twenty marks, along with an equal annual sum, for which the
daily pitcher of wine granted in 1374 had been commuted.
Before his departure for Lombardy, Chaucer — still holding his
post in the Customs — selected two representatives or trustees,
to protect his estate against legal proceedings in his absence, or
to sue in his name defaulters and offenders against the imposts
which he was charged to enforce. One of these trustees was
called Richard Forrester; the other was John Gower, the poet,
the most famous English contemporary of Chaucer, with whom
he had for many years been on terms of admiring friendship —
although, from the strictures passed on certain productions of
Gower's in the Prologue to The Man of Law's Tale,&lt;6&gt; it has
been supposed that in the later years of Chaucer's life the
friendship suffered some diminution. To the "moral Gower" and
"the philosophical Strode," Chaucer "directed" or dedicated his
"Troilus and Cressida;" &lt;7&gt; while, in the "Confessio Amantis,"
Gower introduces a handsome compliment to his greater
contemporary, as the "disciple and the poet" of Venus, with
whose glad songs and ditties, made in her praise during the
flowers of his youth, the land was filled everywhere.  Gower,
however — a monk and a Conservative — held to the party of
the Duke of Gloucester, the rival of the Wycliffite and
innovating Duke of Lancaster, who was Chaucer's patron, and
whose cause was not a little aided by Chaucer's strictures on the
clergy; and thus it is not impossible that political differences
may have weakened the old bonds of personal friendship and
poetic esteem. Returning from Lombardy early in 1379,
Chaucer seems to have been again sent abroad; for the records
exhibit no trace of him between May and December of that
year. Whether by proxy or in person, however, he received his
pensions regularly until 1382, when his income was increased
by his appointment to the post of Controller of Petty Customs
in the port of London.  In November 1384, he obtained a
month's leave of absence on account of his private affairs, and a
deputy was appointed to fill his place; and in February of the
next year he was permitted to appoint a permanent deputy —
thus at length gaining relief from that close attention to business
which probably curtailed the poetic fruits of the poet's most
powerful years. &lt;8&gt;</p>

<p id="id00089">Chaucer is next found occupying a post which has not often
been held by men gifted with his peculiar genius — that of a
county member. The contest between the Dukes of Gloucester
and Lancaster, and their adherents, for the control of the
Government, was coming to a crisis; and when the recluse and
studious Chaucer was induced to offer himself to the electors of
Kent as one of the knights of their shire — where presumably he
held property — we may suppose that it was with the view of
supporting his patron's cause in the impending conflict. The
Parliament in which the poet sat assembled at Westminster on
the 1st of October, and was dissolved on the 1st of November,
1386. Lancaster was fighting and intriguing abroad, absorbed in
the affairs of his Castilian succession; Gloucester and his friends
at home had everything their own way; the Earl of Suffolk was
dismissed from the woolsack, and impeached by the Commons;
and although Richard at first stood out courageously for the
friends of his uncle Lancaster, he was constrained, by the refusal
of supplies, to consent to the proceedings of Gloucester. A
commission was wrung from him, under protest, appointing
Gloucester, Arundel, and twelve other Peers and prelates, a
permanent council to inquire into the condition of all the public
departments, the courts of law, and the royal household, with
absolute powers of redress and dismissal. We need not ascribe
to Chaucer's Parliamentary exertions in his patron's behalf, nor
to any malpractices in his official conduct, the fact that he was
among the earliest victims of the commission.&lt;9&gt;  In December
1386, he was dismissed from both his offices in the port of
London; but he retained his pensions, and drew them regularly
twice a year at the Exchequer until 1388. In 1387, Chaucer's
political reverses were aggravated by a severe domestic
calamity: his wife died, and with her died the pension which had
been settled on her by Queen Philippa in 1366, and confirmed to
her at Richard's accession in 1377.  The change made in
Chaucer's pecuniary position, by the loss of his offices and his
wife's pension, must have been very great. It would appear that
during his prosperous times he had lived in a style quite equal to
his income, and had no ample resources against a season of
reverse; for, on the 1st of May 1388, less than a year and a half
after being dismissed from the Customs, he was constrained to
assign his pensions, by surrender in Chancery, to one John
Scalby.  In May 1389, Richard II., now of age, abruptly
resumed the reins of government, which, for more than two
years, had been ably but cruelly managed by Gloucester. The
friends of Lancaster were once more supreme in the royal
councils, and Chaucer speedily profited by the change. On the
12th of July he was appointed Clerk of the King's Works at the
Palace of Westminster, the Tower, the royal manors of
Kennington, Eltham, Clarendon, Sheen, Byfleet, Childern
Langley, and Feckenham, the castle of Berkhamstead, the royal
lodge of Hathenburgh in the New Forest, the lodges in the
parks of Clarendon, Childern Langley, and Feckenham, and the
mews for the King's falcons at Charing Cross; he received a
salary of two shillings per day, and was allowed to perform the
duties by deputy. For some reason unknown, Chaucer held this
lucrative office &lt;10&gt; little more than two years, quitting it
before the 16th of September 1391, at which date it had passed
into the hands of one John Gedney. The next two years and a
half are a blank, so far as authentic records are concerned;
Chaucer is supposed to have passed them in retirement,
probably devoting them principally to the composition of The
Canterbury Tales. In February 1394, the King conferred upon
him a grant of L20 a year for life; but he seems to have had no
other source of income, and to have become embarrassed by
debt, for frequent memoranda of small advances on his pension
show that his circumstances were, in comparison, greatly
reduced.  Things appear to have grown worse and worse with
the poet; for in May 1398 he was compelled to obtain from the
King letters of protection against arrest, extending over a term
of two years. Not for the first time, it is true — for similar
documents had been issued at the beginning of Richard's reign;
but at that time Chaucer's missions abroad, and his responsible
duties in the port of London, may have furnished reasons for
securing him against annoyance or frivolous prosecution, which
were wholly wanting at the later date.  In 1398, fortune began
again to smile upon him; he received a royal grant of a tun of
wine annually, the value being about L4. Next year, Richard II
having been deposed by the son of John of Gaunt &lt;11&gt;  —
Henry of Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster — the new King, four
days after hits accession, bestowed on Chaucer a grant of forty
marks (L26, 13s. 4d.) per annum, in addition to the pension of
L20 conferred by Richard II. in 1394.  But the poet, now
seventy-one years of age, and probably broken down by the
reverses of the past few years, was not destined long to enjoy
his renewed prosperity.  On Christmas Eve of 1399, he entered
on the possession of a house in the garden of the Chapel of the
Blessed Mary of Westminster — near to the present site of
Henry VII.'s Chapel — having obtained a lease from Robert
Hermodesworth, a monk of the adjacent convent, for fifty-three
years, at the annual rent of four marks (L2, 13s. 4d.) Until the
1st of March 1400, Chaucer drew his pensions in person; then
they were received for him by another hand; and on the 25th of
October, in the same year, he died, at the age of seventy-two.
The only lights thrown by his poems on his closing days are
furnished in the little ballad called "Good Counsel of Chaucer,"
— which, though said to have been written when "upon his
death-bed lying in his great anguish, "breathes the very spirit of
courage, resignation, and philosophic calm; and by the
"Retractation" at the end of The Canterbury Tales, which, if it
was not foisted in by monkish transcribers, may be supposed the
effect of Chaucer's regrets and self-reproaches on that solemn
review of his life-work which the close approach of death
compelled. The poet was buried in Westminster Abbey; &lt;12&gt;
and not many years after his death a slab was  placed on a pillar
near his grave, bearing the lines, taken from an epitaph or
eulogy made by Stephanus Surigonus of Milan, at the request of
Caxton:</p>

<p id="id00090">"Galfridus Chaucer, vates, et fama poesis<br>

Maternae, hoc sacra sum tumulatus humo." &lt;13&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00091">About 1555, Mr Nicholas Brigham, a gentleman of Oxford who
greatly admired the genius of Chaucer, erected the present
tomb, as near to the spot where the poet lay, "before the chapel
of St Benet," as was then possible by reason of the "cancelli,"
&lt;14&gt; which the Duke of Buckingham subsequently obtained
leave to remove, that room might be made for the tomb of
Dryden.  On the structure of Mr Brigham, besides a full-length
representation of Chaucer, taken from a portrait drawn by his
"scholar" Thomas Occleve, was — or is, though now almost
illegible — the following inscription:—</p>

<p id="id00092">                              M. S.<br>

            QUI FUIT ANGLORUM VATES TER MAXIMUS OLIM,<br>

             GALFRIDUS CHAUCER CONDITUR HOC TUMULO;<br>

            ANNUM SI QUAERAS DOMINI, SI TEMPORA VITAE,<br>

           ECCE NOTAE SUBSUNT, QUE TIBI CUNCTA NOTANT.<br>

                        25 OCTOBRIS 1400.<br>

                    AERUMNARUM REQUIES MORS.<br>

           N. BRIGHAM HOS FECIT MUSARUM NOMINE SUMPTUS<br>

                              1556. &lt;15&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00093">Concerning his personal appearance and habits, Chaucer has not
been reticent in his poetry. Urry sums up the traits of his aspect
and character fairly thus: "He was of a middle stature, the latter
part of his life inclinable to be fat and corpulent, as appears by
the Host's bantering him in the journey to Canterbury, and
comparing shapes with him.&lt;16&gt;  His face was fleshy, his
features just and regular, his complexion fair, and somewhat
pale, his hair of a dusky yellow, short and thin; the hair of his
beard in two forked tufts, of a wheat colour; his forehead broad
and smooth; his eyes inclining usually to the ground, which is
intimated by the Host's words; his whole face full of liveliness, a
calm, easy sweetness, and a studious Venerable aspect. . . . As
to his temper, he had a mixture of the gay, the modest, and the
grave. The sprightliness of his humour was more distinguished
by his writings than by his appearance; which gave occasion to
Margaret Countess of Pembroke often to rally him upon his
silent modesty in company, telling him, that his absence was
more agreeable to her than his conversation, since the first was
productive of agreeable pieces of wit in his writings, &lt;17&gt; but
the latter was filled with a modest deference, and a too distant
respect.  We see nothing merry or jocose in his behaviour with
his pilgrims, but a silent attention to their mirth, rather than any
mixture of his own. . .  When disengaged from public affairs, his
time was entirely spent in study and reading; so agreeable to
him was this exercise, that he says he preferred it to all other
sports and diversions.&lt;18&gt;  He lived within himself, neither
desirous to hear nor busy to concern himself with the affairs of
his neighbours. His course of living was temperate and regular;
he went to rest with the sun, and rose before it; and by that
means enjoyed the pleasures of the better part of the day, his
morning walk and fresh contemplations.  This gave him the
advantage of describing the morning in so lively a manner as he
does everywhere in his works. The springing sun glows warm in
his lines, and the fragrant air blows cool in his descriptions; we
smell the sweets of the bloomy haws, and hear the music of the
feathered choir, whenever we take a forest walk with him. The
hour of the day is not easier to be discovered from the reflection
of the sun in Titian's paintings, than in Chaucer's morning
landscapes. . . . His reading was deep and extensive, his
judgement sound and discerning. . . In one word, he was a great
scholar, a pleasant wit, a candid critic, a sociable companion, a
steadfast friend, a grave philosopher, a temperate economist,
and a pious Christian."</p>

<p id="id00094">Chaucer's most important poems are "Troilus and Cressida,"
"The Romaunt of the Rose," and "The Canterbury Tales."  Of
the first, containing 8246 lines, an abridgement, with a prose
connecting outline of the story, is given in this volume. With the
second, consisting of 7699 octosyllabic verses, like those in
which "The House of Fame" is written, it was found impossible
to deal in the present edition. The poem is a curtailed translation
from the French "Roman de la Rose" — commenced by
Guillaume de Lorris, who died in 1260, after contributing 4070
verses, and completed, in the last quarter of the thirteenth
century, by Jean de Meun, who added some 18,000 verses. It is
a satirical allegory, in which the vices of courts, the corruptions
of the clergy, the disorders and inequalities of society in general,
are unsparingly attacked, and the most revolutionary doctrines
are advanced; and though, in making his translation, Chaucer
softened or eliminated much of the satire of the poem, still it
remained, in his verse, a caustic exposure of the abuses of the
time, especially those which discredited the Church.</p>

<p id="id00095">The Canterbury Tales are presented in this edition with as near
an approach to completeness as regard for the popular character
of the volume permitted. The 17,385 verses, of which the
poetical Tales consist, have been given without abridgement or
purgation — save in a single couplet; but, the main purpose of
the volume being to make the general reader acquainted with
the "poems" of Chaucer and Spenser, the Editor has ventured to
contract the two prose Tales — Chaucer's Tale of Meliboeus,
and the Parson's Sermon or Treatise on Penitence — so as to
save about thirty pages for the introduction of Chaucer's minor
pieces. At the same time, by giving prose outlines of the omitted
parts, it has been sought to guard the reader against the fear
that he was losing anything essential, or even valuable. It is
almost needless to describe the plot, or point out the literary
place, of the Canterbury Tales. Perhaps in the entire range of
ancient and modern literature there is no work that so clearly
and freshly paints for future times the picture of the past;
certainly no Englishman has ever approached Chaucer in the
power of fixing for ever the fleeting traits of his own time.  The
plan of the poem had been adopted before Chaucer chose it;
notably in the "Decameron" of Boccaccio — although, there, the
circumstances under which the tales were told, with the terror
of the plague hanging over the merry company, lend a grim
grotesqueness to the narrative, unless we can look at it
abstracted from its setting.  Chaucer, on the other hand, strikes
a perpetual key-note of gaiety whenever he mentions the word
"pilgrimage;" and at every stage of the connecting story we
bless the happy thought which gives us incessant incident,
movement, variety, and unclouded but never monotonous
joyousness.</p>

<p id="id00096">The poet, the evening before he starts on a pilgrimage to the
shrine of St Thomas at Canterbury, lies at the Tabard Inn, in
Southwark, curious to know in what companionship he is
destined to fare forward on the morrow. Chance sends him
"nine and twenty in a company," representing all orders of
English society, lay and clerical, from the Knight and the Abbot
down to the Ploughman and the Sompnour. The jolly Host of
the Tabard, after supper, when tongues are loosened and hearts
are opened, declares that "not this year" has he seen such a
company at once under his roof-tree, and proposes that, when
they set out next morning, he should ride with them and make
them sport. All agree, and Harry Bailly unfolds his scheme: each
pilgrim, including the poet, shall tell two tales on the road to
Canterbury, and two on the way back to London; and he whom
the general voice pronounces to have told the best tale, shall be
treated to a supper at the common cost — and, of course, to
mine Host's profit — when the cavalcade returns from the saint's
shrine to the Southwark hostelry. All joyously assent; and early
on the morrow, in the gay spring sunshine, they ride forth,
listening to the heroic tale of the brave and gentle Knight, who
has been gracefully chosen by the Host to lead the spirited
competition of story-telling.</p>

<p id="id00097">To describe thus the nature of the plan, and to say that when
Chaucer conceived, or at least began to execute it, he was
between sixty and seventy years of age, is to proclaim that The
Canterbury Tales could never be more than a fragment. Thirty
pilgrims, each telling two tales on the way out, and two more
on the way back — that makes 120 tales; to say nothing of the
prologue, the description of the journey, the occurrences at
Canterbury, "and all the remnant of their pilgrimage," which
Chaucer also undertook. No more than twenty-three of the 120
stories are told in the work as it comes down to us; that is, only
twenty-three of the thirty pilgrims tell the first of the two stories
on the road to Canterbury; while of the stories on the return
journey we have not one, and nothing is said about the doings
of the pilgrims at Canterbury — which would, if treated like the
scene at the Tabard, have given us a still livelier "picture of the
period." But the plan was too large; and although the poet had
some reserves, in stories which he had already composed in an
independent form, death cut short his labour ere he could even
complete the arrangement and connection of more than a very
few of the Tales. Incomplete as it is, however, the magnum
opus of Chaucer was in his own time received with immense
favour; manuscript copies are numerous even now — no slight
proof of its popularity; and when the invention of printing was
introduced into England by William Caxton, The Canterbury
Tales issued from his press in the year after the first English-
printed book, "The Game of the Chesse," had been struck off.
Innumerable editions have since been published; and it may
fairly be affirmed, that few books have been so much in favour
with the reading public of every generation as this book, which
the lapse of every generation has been rendering more
unreadable.</p>

<p id="id00098">Apart from "The Romaunt of the Rose," no really important
poetical work of Chaucer's is omitted from or unrepresented in
the present edition. Of "The Legend of Good Women," the
Prologue only is given — but it is the most genuinely Chaucerian
part of the poem.  Of "The Court of Love," three-fourths are
here presented; of "The Assembly of Fowls," "The Cuckoo and
the Nightingale," "The Flower and the Leaf," all; of "Chaucer's
Dream," one-fourth; of "The House of Fame," two-thirds; and
of the minor poems such a selection as may give an idea of
Chaucer's power in the "occasional" department of verse.
Necessarily, no space whatever could be given to Chaucer's
prose works — his translation of Boethius' Treatise on the
Consolation of Philosophy; his Treatise on the Astrolabe,
written for the use of his son Lewis; and his "Testament of
Love," composed in his later years, and reflecting the troubles
that then beset the poet. If, after studying in a simplified form
the salient works of England's first great bard, the reader is
tempted to regret that he was not introduced to a wider
acquaintance with the author, the purpose of the Editor will
have been more than attained.</p>

<p id="id00099">The plan of the volume does not demand an elaborate
examination into the state of our language when Chaucer wrote,
or the nice questions of grammatical and metrical structure
which conspire with the obsolete orthography to make his
poems a sealed book for the masses. The most important
element in the proper reading of Chaucer's verses — whether
written in the decasyllabic or heroic metre, which he introduced
into our literature, or in the octosyllabic measure used with such
animated effect in "The House of Fame," "Chaucer's Dream,"
&amp;c. — is the sounding of the terminal "e" where it is now silent.
That letter is still valid in French poetry; and Chaucer's lines can
be scanned only by reading them as we would read Racine's or
Moliere's. The terminal "e" played an important part in
grammar; in many cases it was the sign of the infinitive — the
"n" being dropped from the end; at other times it pointed the
distinction between singular and plural, between adjective and
adverb. The pages that follow, however, being prepared from
the modern English point of view, necessarily no account is
taken of those distinctions; and the now silent "e" has been
retained in the text of Chaucer only when required by the
modern spelling, or by the exigencies of metre.</p>

<p id="id00100">Before a word beginning with a vowel, or with the letter "h,"
the final "e" was almost without exception mute; and in such
cases, in the plural forms and infinitives of verbs, the terminal
"n" is generally retained for the sake of euphony. No reader
who is acquainted with the French language will find it hard to
fall into Chaucer's accentuation; while, for such as are not, a
simple perusal of the text according to the rules of modern

<p id="id00102" style="margin-top: 2em">1. "Edmund Spenser, a native of London, was born with a Muse
of such power, that he was superior to all English poets of
preceding ages, not excepting his fellow-citizen Chaucer."</p>

<p id="id00103">2. See introduction to "The Legend of Good Women".</p>

<p id="id00104">3. Called in the editions before 1597 "The Dream of Chaucer".
The poem, which is not included in the present edition, does
indeed, like many of Chaucer's smaller works, tell the story of a
dream, in which a knight, representing John of Gaunt, is found
by the poet mourning the loss of his lady; but the true "Dream
of Chaucer," in which he celebrates the marriage of his patron,
was published for the first time by Speght in 1597. John of
Gaunt, in the end of 1371, married his second wife, Constance,
daughter to Pedro the Cruel of Spain; so that "The Book of the
Duchess" must have been written between 1369 and 1371.</p>

<p id="id00105">4. Where he bids his "little book"<br>

"Subject be unto all poesy,<br>

And kiss the steps, where as thou seest space,<br>

Of Virgil, Ovid, Homer, Lucan, Stace."<br>

<p id="id00108">7. "Written," says Mr Wright, "in the sixteenth year of the reign
of Richard II. (1392-1393);" a powerful confirmation of the
opinion that this poem was really produced in Chaucer's mature
age. See the introductory notes to it and to the Legend of Good
Women.</p>

<p id="id00109">8. The old biographers of Chaucer, founding on what they took
to be autobiographic allusions in "The Testament of Love,"
assign to him between 1354 and 1389 a very different history
from that here given on the strength of authentic records
explored and quoted by Sir H. Nicolas. Chaucer is made to
espouse the cause of John of Northampton, the Wycliffite Lord
Mayor of London, whose re-election in 1384 was so
vehemently opposed by the clergy, and who was imprisoned in
the sequel of the grave disorders that arose. The poet, it is said,
fled to the Continent, taking with him a large sum of money,
which he spent in supporting companions in exile; then,
returning by stealth to England in quest of funds, he was
detected and sent to the Tower, where he languished for three
years, being released only on the humiliating condition of
informing against his associates in the plot. The public records
show, however, that, all the time of his alleged exile and
captivity, he was quietly living in London, regularly drawing his
pensions in person, sitting in Parliament, and discharging his
duties in the Customs until his dismissal in 1386. It need not be
said, further, that although Chaucer freely handled the errors,
the ignorance, and vices of the clergy, he did so rather as a man
of sense and of conscience, than as a Wycliffite — and there is
no evidence that he espoused the opinions of the zealous
Reformer, far less played the part of an extreme and self-
regardless partisan of his old friend and college-companion.</p>

<p id="id00110">9. "The Commissioners appear to have commenced their
labours with examining the accounts of the officers employed in
the collection of the revenue; and the sequel affords a strong
presumption that the royal administration [under Lancaster and
his friends] had been foully calumniated. We hear not of any
frauds discovered, or of defaulters punished, or of grievances
redressed." Such is the testimony of Lingard (chap. iv., 1386),
all the more valuable for his aversion from the Wycliffite
leanings of John of Gaunt. Chaucer's department in the London
Customs was in those days one of the most important and
lucrative in the kingdom; and if mercenary abuse of his post
could have been proved, we may be sure that his and his
patron's enemies would not have been content with simple
dismissal, but would have heavily amerced or imprisoned him.</p>

<p id="id00111">10. The salary was L36, 10s. per annum; the salary of the Chief
Judges was L40, of the Puisne Judges about L27. Probably the
Judges — certainly the Clerk of the Works — had fees or
perquisites besides the stated payment.</p>

<p id="id00112">11. Chaucer's patron had died earlier in 1399, during the exile
of his son (then Duke of Hereford) in France. The Duchess
Constance had died in 1394; and the Duke had made reparation
to Katherine Swynford — who had already borne him four
children — by marrying her in 1396, with the approval of
Richard II., who legitimated the children, and made the eldest
son of the poet's sister-in-law Earl of Somerset. From this long-
illicit union sprang the house of Beaufort — that being the
surname of the Duke's children by Katherine, after the name of
the castle in Anjou (Belfort, or Beaufort) where they were born.</p>

<p id="id00113">12. Of Chaucer's two sons by Philippa Roet, his only wife, the
younger, Lewis, for whom he wrote the Treatise on the
Astrolabe, died young.  The elder, Thomas, married Maud, the
second daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Burghersh, brother
of the Bishop of Lincoln, the Chancellor and Treasurer of
England. By this marriage Thomas Chaucer acquired great
estates in Oxfordshire and elsewhere; and he figured
prominently in the second rank of courtiers for many years. He
was Chief Butler to Richard II.; under Henry IV. he was
Constable of Wallingford Castle, Steward of the Honours of
Wallingford and St Valery, and of the Chiltern Hundreds; and
the queen of Henry IV. granted him the farm of several of her
manors, a grant subsequently confirmed to him for life by the
King, after the Queen's death. He sat in Parliament repeatedly
for Oxfordshire, was Speaker in 1414, and in the same year
went to France as commissioner to negotiate the marriage of
Henry V. with the Princess Katherine. He held, before he died
in 1434, various other posts of trust and distinction; but he left
no heirs-male.  His only child, Alice Chaucer, married twice;
first Sir John Philip; and afterwards the Duke of Suffolk —
attainted and beheaded in 1450.  She had three children by the
Duke; and her eldest son married the Princess Elizabeth, sister
of Edward IV. The eldest son of this marriage, created Earl of
Lincoln, was declared by Richard III heir-apparent to the
throne, in case the Prince of Wales should die without issue; but
the death of Lincoln himself, at the battle of Stoke in 1487,
destroyed all prospect that the poet's descendants might
succeed to the crown of England; and his family is now believed
to be extinct.</p>

<p id="id00125">A KNIGHT there was, and that a worthy man,<br>

That from the time that he first began<br>

To riden out, he loved chivalry,<br>

Truth and honour, freedom and courtesy.<br>

Full worthy was he in his Lorde's war,<br>

And thereto had he ridden, no man farre*,                       *farther<br>

As well in Christendom as in Heatheness,<br>

And ever honour'd for his worthiness<br>

Above alle nations in Prusse.&lt;7&gt;<br>

In Lettowe had he reysed,* and in Russe,                      *journeyed<br>

No Christian man so oft of his degree.<br>

In Grenade at the siege eke had he be<br>

Of Algesir, and ridden in Belmarie. &lt;8&gt;<br>

At Leyes was he, and at Satalie,<br>

When they were won; and in the Greate Sea<br>

At many a noble army had he be.<br>

At mortal battles had he been fifteen,<br>

And foughten for our faith at Tramissene.<br>

In listes thries, and aye slain his foe.<br>

This ilke* worthy knight had been also                         *same &lt;9&gt;<br>

Some time with the lord of Palatie,<br>

Against another heathen in Turkie:<br>

And of his port as meek as is a maid.<br>

He never yet no villainy ne said<br>

In all his life, unto no manner wight.<br>

He was a very perfect gentle knight.<br>

But for to telle you of his array,<br>

His horse was good, but yet he was not gay.<br>

Of fustian he weared a gipon*,                            *short doublet<br>

Of twenty year of age he was I guess.<br>

Of his stature he was of even length,<br>

All full of freshe flowers, white and red.<br>

Well could he dress his tackle yeomanly:<br>

His arrows drooped not with feathers low;<br>

Of which achatours* mighte take ensample                         *buyers<br>

For to be wise in buying of vitaille*.                         *victuals<br>

For whether that he paid, or took *by taile*,                 *on credit<br>

Algate* he waited so in his achate**,                 *always **purchase<br>

That he was aye before in good estate.<br>

Now is not that of God a full fair grace<br>

That such a lewed* mannes wit shall pace**          *unlearned **surpass<br>

The wisdom of an heap of learned men?<br>

Of masters had he more than thries ten,<br>

That were of law expert and curious:<br>

Of which there was a dozen in that house,<br>

Worthy to be stewards of rent and land<br>

Of any lord that is in Engleland,<br>

To make him live by his proper good,<br>

In honour debtless, *but if he were wood*,          *unless he were mad*<br>

Or live as scarcely as him list desire;<br>

And able for to helpen all a shire<br>

In any case that mighte fall or hap;<br>

And yet this Manciple *set their aller cap*         *outwitted them all*<br>

<p id="id00145">The REEVE &lt;49&gt; was a slender choleric man<br>

His beard was shav'd as nigh as ever he can.<br>

His hair was by his eares round y-shorn;<br>

His top was docked like a priest beforn<br>

Full longe were his legges, and full lean<br>

Y-like a staff, there was no calf y-seen<br>

Well could he keep a garner* and a bin*           *storeplaces for grain<br>

There was no auditor could on him win<br>

Well wist he by the drought, and by the rain,<br>

The yielding of his seed and of his grain<br>

His lorde's sheep, his neat*, and his dairy                      *cattle<br>

His swine, his horse, his store, and his poultry,<br>

Were wholly in this Reeve's governing,<br>

And by his cov'nant gave he reckoning,<br>

Since that his lord was twenty year of age;<br>

There could no man bring him in arrearage<br>

There was no bailiff, herd, nor other hine*                     *servant<br>

That he ne knew his *sleight and his covine*       *tricks and cheating*<br>

They were adrad* of him, as of the death                       *in dread<br>

His wonning* was full fair upon an heath                          *abode<br>

With greene trees y-shadow'd was his place.<br>

He coulde better than his lord purchase<br>

Full rich he was y-stored privily<br>

His lord well could he please subtilly,<br>

To give and lend him of his owen good,<br>

And have a thank, and yet* a coat and hood.                        *also<br>

In youth he learned had a good mistere*                           *trade<br>

He was a well good wright, a carpentere<br>

This Reeve sate upon a right good stot*,                          *steed<br>

That was all pomely* gray, and highte** Scot.          *dappled **called<br>

A long surcoat of perse* upon he had,                          *sky-blue<br>

And by his side he bare a rusty blade.<br>

Of Norfolk was this Reeve, of which I tell,<br>

Beside a town men clepen* Baldeswell,                              *call<br>

Tucked he was, as is a friar, about,<br>

And ever rode the *hinderest of the rout*.       *hindmost of the group*<br>
</p>

<p id="id00146">A SOMPNOUR* was there with us in that place,              *summoner &lt;50&gt;<br>

That had a fire-red cherubinnes face,<br>

For sausefleme* he was, with eyen narrow.                 *red or pimply<br>

As hot he was and lecherous as a sparrow,<br>

With scalled browes black, and pilled* beard:                    *scanty<br>

Of his visage children were sore afeard.<br>

There n'as quicksilver, litharge, nor brimstone,<br>

Boras, ceruse, nor oil of tartar none,<br>

Nor ointement that woulde cleanse or bite,<br>

That him might helpen of his whelkes* white,                   *pustules<br>

Nor of the knobbes* sitting on his cheeks.                      *buttons<br>

Well lov'd he garlic, onions, and leeks,<br>

And for to drink strong wine as red as blood.<br>

Then would he speak, and cry as he were wood;<br>

And when that he well drunken had the wine,<br>

Then would he speake no word but Latin.<br>

A fewe termes knew he, two or three,<br>

That he had learned out of some decree;<br>

No wonder is, he heard it all the day.<br>

And eke ye knowen well, how that a jay<br>

Can clepen* "Wat," as well as can the Pope.                        *call<br>

But whoso would in other thing him grope*,                       *search<br>

Then had he spent all his philosophy,<br>

Aye, Questio quid juris,&lt;51&gt; would he cry.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00147">He was a gentle harlot* and a kind;                    *a low fellow&lt;52&gt;<br>

A better fellow should a man not find.<br>

He woulde suffer, for a quart of wine,<br>

A good fellow to have his concubine<br>

A twelvemonth, and excuse him at the full.<br>

Full privily a *finch eke could he pull*.               *"fleece" a man*<br>

And if he found owhere* a good fellaw,                         *anywhere<br>

He woulde teache him to have none awe<br>

In such a case of the archdeacon's curse;<br>

*But if* a manne's soul were in his purse;                      *unless*<br>

For in his purse he should y-punished be.<br>

"Purse is the archedeacon's hell," said he.<br>

But well I wot, he lied right indeed:<br>

Of cursing ought each guilty man to dread,<br>

For curse will slay right as assoiling* saveth;               *absolving<br>

And also 'ware him of a significavit&lt;53&gt;.<br>

In danger had he at his owen guise<br>

The younge girles of the diocese, &lt;54&gt;<br>

And knew their counsel, and was of their rede*.                 *counsel<br>

A garland had he set upon his head,<br>

As great as it were for an alestake*:      *The post of an alehouse sign<br>

A buckler had he made him of a cake.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00148">With him there rode a gentle PARDONERE &lt;55&gt;<br>

Of Ronceval, his friend and his compere,<br>

That straight was comen from the court of Rome.<br>

Full loud he sang, "Come hither, love, to me"<br>

This Sompnour *bare to him a stiff burdoun*,             *sang the bass*<br>

Was never trump of half so great a soun'.<br>

This Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,<br>

But smooth it hung, as doth a strike* of flax:                    *strip<br>

By ounces hung his lockes that he had,<br>

And therewith he his shoulders oversprad.<br>

Full thin it lay, by culpons* one and one,                *locks, shreds<br>

But hood for jollity, he weared none,<br>

For it was trussed up in his wallet.<br>

Him thought he rode all of the *newe get*,          *latest fashion*&lt;56&gt;<br>

Dishevel, save his cap, he rode all bare.<br>

Such glaring eyen had he, as an hare.<br>

A vernicle*  had he sew'd upon his cap.            *image of Christ &lt;57&gt;<br>

His wallet lay before him in his lap,<br>

Bretful* of pardon come from Rome all hot.                      *brimful<br>

A voice he had as small as hath a goat.<br>

No beard had he, nor ever one should have.<br>

As smooth it was as it were new y-shave;<br>

I trow he were a gelding or a mare.<br>

But of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware,<br>

Ne was there such another pardonere.<br>

For in his mail* he had a pillowbere**,           *bag &lt;58&gt; **pillowcase<br>

Which, as he saide, was our Lady's veil:<br>

He said, he had a gobbet* of the sail                             *piece<br>

That Sainte Peter had, when that he went<br>

Upon the sea, till Jesus Christ him hent*.                 *took hold of<br>

He had a cross of latoun* full of stones,                        *copper<br>

And in a glass he hadde pigge's bones.<br>

But with these relics, whenne that he fond<br>

A poore parson dwelling upon lond,<br>

Upon a day he got him more money<br>

Than that the parson got in moneths tway;<br>

And thus with feigned flattering and japes*,                      *jests<br>

He made the parson and the people his apes.<br>

But truely to tellen at the last,<br>

He was in church a noble ecclesiast.<br>

Well could he read a lesson or a story,<br>

But alderbest* he sang an offertory:                        *best of all<br>

For well he wiste, when that song was sung,<br>

He muste preach, and well afile* his tongue,                     *polish<br>

To winne silver, as he right well could:<br>

Therefore he sang full merrily and loud.<br>

<p id="id00149">Now have I told you shortly in a clause<br>

Th' estate, th' array, the number, and eke the cause<br>

Why that assembled was this company<br>

In Southwark at this gentle hostelry,<br>

That highte the Tabard, fast by the Bell.&lt;59&gt;<br>

But now is time to you for to tell<br>

*How that we baren us that ilke night*,    *what we did that same night*<br>

When we were in that hostelry alight.<br>

And after will I tell of our voyage,<br>

And all the remnant of our pilgrimage.<br>

But first I pray you of your courtesy,<br>

That ye *arette it not my villainy*,       *count it not rudeness in me*<br>

Though that I plainly speak in this mattere.<br>

To tellen you their wordes and their cheer;<br>

Not though I speak their wordes properly.<br>

For this ye knowen all so well as I,<br>

Whoso shall tell a tale after a man,<br>

He must rehearse, as nigh as ever he can,<br>

Every word, if it be in his charge,<br>

*All speak he* ne'er so rudely and so large;             *let him speak*<br>

Or elles he must tell his tale untrue,<br>

Or feigne things, or finde wordes new.<br>

He may not spare, although he were his brother;<br>

He must as well say one word as another.<br>

Christ spake Himself full broad in Holy Writ,<br>

And well ye wot no villainy is it.<br>

Eke Plato saith, whoso that can him read,<br>

The wordes must be cousin to the deed.<br>

For truely comfort nor mirth is none<br>

To ride by the way as dumb as stone:<br>

And therefore would I make you disport,<br>

That is to say, that telleth in this case<br>

And he began with right a merry cheer<br>

His tale anon, and said as ye shall hear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00154" style="margin-top: 3em">Notes to the Prologue</p>

<p id="id00155" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Tyrwhitt points out that "the Bull" should be read  here, not
"the Ram," which would place the time of  the pilgrimage in the
end of March; whereas, in the Prologue to the Man of Law's
Tale, the date is given as the "eight and  twenty day of April,
that is messenger to May."</p>

<p id="id00156">2. Dante, in the "Vita Nuova," distinguishes three classes of
pilgrims: palmieri - palmers who go beyond  sea to the East,
and often bring back staves of palm-wood; peregrini, who go
the shrine of St Jago in Galicia; Romei, who go to Rome.   Sir
Walter Scott, however, says that palmers were in the habit of
passing from shrine to shrine, living on charity — pilgrims on the
other hand, made the journey to any shrine only once,
immediately returning to their ordinary avocations. Chaucer
uses "palmer" of all pilgrims.</p>

<p id="id00157">3. "Hallows" survives, in the meaning here given, in All Hallows
— All-Saints — day.  "Couth," past participle of "conne" to
know, exists in "uncouth."</p>

<p id="id00158">4. The Tabard — the sign of the inn — was a sleeveless coat,
worn by heralds.  The name of the inn was, some three
centuries after Chaucer, changed to the Talbot.</p>

<p id="id00159">5. In y-fall," "y" is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon "ge"
prefixed to participles of verbs.  It is used by Chaucer merely to
help the metre  In German,  "y-fall," or  y-falle," would be
"gefallen",  "y-run," or "y-ronne", would be "geronnen."</p>

<p id="id00160">6. Alisandre: Alexandria, in Egypt, captured by Pierre de
Lusignan, king of Cyprus, in 1365 but abandoned immediately
afterwards.  Thirteen years before, the same Prince had taken
Satalie, the ancient Attalia, in Anatolia, and in 1367 he won
Layas, in Armenia, both places named just below.</p>

<p id="id00161">7. The knight had been placed at the head of the table, above
knights of all nations, in Prussia, whither warriors from all
countries were wont to repair, to aid the Teutonic Order in their
continual conflicts with their heathen neighbours in  "Lettowe"
or Lithuania (German. "Litthauen"), Russia, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00162">8. Algesiras was taken from the Moorish king of Grenada, in
1344: the Earls of Derby and Salisbury took part in the siege.
Belmarie is supposed to have been a Moorish state in Africa;
but "Palmyrie" has been suggested as the correct reading. The
Great Sea, or  the Greek sea, is the Eastern Mediterranean.
Tramissene, or Tremessen, is enumerated by Froissart among
the Moorish kingdoms in Africa. Palatie, or  Palathia, in
Anatolia, was a fief held by the Christian  knights after the
Turkish conquests — the holders paying tribute to the infidel.
Our knight had fought with one of those lords against a heathen
neighbour.</p>

<p id="id00163">9. Ilke: same; compare the Scottish phrase "of that ilk," —
that is, of the estate which bears the same name as its owner's
title.</p>

<p id="id00164">10. It was the custom for squires of the highest degree to carve
at their fathers' tables.</p>

<p id="id00165">11. Peacock Arrows: Large arrows, with peacocks' feathers.</p>

<p id="id00166">12. A nut-head: With nut-brown hair; or, round like a nut, the
hair being cut short.</p>

<p id="id00167">13. Grey eyes appear to have been a mark of female beauty in
Chaucer's time.</p>

<p id="id00168">14. "for the mastery" was applied to medicines in the sense of
"sovereign" as we now apply it to a remedy.</p>

<p id="id00169">15. It was fashionable to hang bells on horses' bridles.</p>

<p id="id00170">16. St. Benedict was the first founder of a spiritual order in the
Roman church.  Maurus, abbot of Fulda from 822 to 842, did
much to re-establish the discipline of the Benedictines on a true
Christian basis.</p>

<p id="id00171">17. Wood: Mad, Scottish "wud".  Felix says to Paul, "Too
much learning hath made thee mad".</p>

<p id="id00172">18. Limitour: A friar with licence or privilege to beg, or

Of our lineage have some compassion,<br>

That is so low y-brought by tyranny."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00230">And with that word Arcita *gan espy*               *began to look forth*<br>

Where as this lady roamed to and fro<br>

And with that sight her beauty hurt him so,<br>

That if that Palamon was wounded sore,<br>

Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more.<br>

And with a sigh he saide piteously:<br>

"The freshe beauty slay'th me suddenly<br>

Of her that roameth yonder in the place.<br>

And but* I have her mercy and her grace,                         *unless<br>

That I may see her at the leaste way,<br>

I am but dead; there is no more to say."<br>

This Palamon, when he these wordes heard,<br>

Dispiteously* he looked, and answer'd:                          *angrily<br>

"Whether say'st thou this in earnest or in play?"<br>

"Nay," quoth Arcite, "in earnest, by my fay*.                     *faith<br>

God help me so, *me lust full ill to play*."          *I am in no humour<br>

This Palamon gan knit his browes tway.                      for jesting*<br>

"It were," quoth he, "to thee no great honour<br>

For to be false, nor for to be traitour<br>

To me, that am thy cousin and thy brother<br>

But that thou shouldest truly farther me<br>

In every case, as I should farther thee.<br>

This was thine oath, and mine also certain;<br>

I wot it well, thou dar'st it not withsayn*,                       *deny<br>

Thus art thou of my counsel out of doubt,<br>

</p>

<p id="id00231">This Arcita full proudly spake again:<br>

"Thou shalt," quoth he, "be rather* false than I,                *sooner<br>

For par amour I lov'd her first ere thou.<br>

What wilt thou say? *thou wist it not right now*          *even now thou<br>

Whether she be a woman or goddess.                          knowest not*<br>

Thine is affection of holiness,<br>

Love is a greater lawe, by my pan,<br>

Than may be giv'n to any earthly man:<br>

Therefore positive law, and such decree,<br>

Is broke alway for love in each degree<br>

A man must needes love, maugre his head.<br>

He may not flee it, though he should be dead,<br>

*All be she* maid, or widow, or else wife.              *whether she be*<br>

We strive, as did the houndes for the bone;<br>

They fought all day, and yet their part was none.<br>

There came a kite, while that they were so wroth,<br>

And bare away the bone betwixt them both.<br>

And therefore at the kinge's court, my brother,<br>

Each man for himselfe, there is no  other.<br>

Love if thee list; for I love and aye shall<br>

</p>

<p id="id00232">Great was the strife and long between these tway,<br>

If that I hadde leisure for to say;<br>

But to the effect: it happen'd on a day<br>

(To tell it you as shortly as I may),<br>

A worthy duke that hight Perithous&lt;14&gt;<br>

That fellow was to the Duke Theseus<br>

Since thilke* day that they were children lite**          *that **little<br>

Was come to Athens, his fellow to visite,<br>

And for to play, as he was wont to do;<br>

For in this world he loved no man so;<br>

And he lov'd him as tenderly again.<br>

So well they lov'd, as olde bookes sayn,<br>

That when that one was dead, soothly to sayn,<br>

His fellow went and sought him down in hell:<br>

But of that story list me not to write.<br>

Duke Perithous loved well Arcite,<br>

And had him known at Thebes year by year:<br>

And finally at request and prayere<br>

Of Perithous, withoute ranson<br>

Duke Theseus him let out of prison,<br>

Freely to go, where him list over all,<br>

In such a guise, as I you tellen shall<br>

This was the forword*, plainly to indite,                       *promise<br>

Betwixte Theseus and him Arcite:<br>

That if so were, that Arcite were y-found<br>

Ever in his life, by day or night, one stound*               *moment&lt;15&gt;<br>

In any country of this Theseus,<br>

And he were caught, it was accorded thus,<br>

That with a sword he shoulde lose his head;<br>

There was none other remedy nor rede*.                          *counsel<br>

But took his leave, and homeward he him sped;<br>

Let him beware, his necke lieth *to wed*.                    *in pledge*<br>
</p>

<p id="id00233">How great a sorrow suff'reth now Arcite!<br>

The death he feeleth through his hearte smite;<br>

He weepeth, waileth, crieth piteously;<br>

To slay himself he waiteth privily.<br>

He said; "Alas the day that I was born!<br>

Now is my prison worse than beforn:<br>

*Now is me shape* eternally to dwell                *it is fixed for me*<br>

Not in purgatory, but right in hell.<br>

Alas! that ever I knew Perithous.<br>

For elles had I dwelt with Theseus<br>

Y-fettered in his prison evermo'.<br>

Then had I been in bliss, and not in woe.<br>

Only the sight of her, whom that I serve,<br>

Though that I never may her grace deserve,<br>

Would have sufficed right enough for me.<br>

O deare cousin Palamon," quoth he,<br>

"Thine is the vict'ry of this aventure,<br>

Full blissfully in prison to endure:<br>

In prison? nay certes, in paradise.<br>

Well hath fortune y-turned thee the dice,<br>

That hast the sight of her, and I th' absence.<br>

For possible is, since thou hast her presence,<br>

And art a knight, a worthy and an able,<br>

That by some cas*, since fortune is changeable,                  *chance<br>

Thou may'st to thy desire sometime attain.<br>

But I that am exiled, and barren<br>

Of alle grace, and in so great despair,<br>

That there n'is earthe, water, fire, nor air,<br>

Nor creature, that of them maked is,<br>

That may me helpe nor comfort in this,<br>

Well ought I *sterve in wanhope* and distress.          *die in despair*<br>

Farewell my life, my lust*, and my gladness.                   *pleasure<br>

Alas, *why plainen men so in commune       *why do men so often complain<br>

Of purveyance of God*, or of Fortune,              of God's providence?*<br>

That giveth them full oft in many a guise<br>

Well better than they can themselves devise?<br>

Some man desireth for to have richess,<br>

That cause is of his murder or great sickness.<br>

And some man would out of his prison fain,<br>

That in his house is of his meinie* slain.                *servants &lt;16&gt;<br>

Infinite harmes be in this mattere.<br>

We wot never what thing we pray for here.<br>

We fare as he that drunk is as a mouse.<br>

A drunken man wot well he hath an house,<br>

But he wot not which is the right way thither,<br>

And to a drunken man the way is slither*.                      *slippery<br>

And certes in this world so fare we.<br>

We seeke fast after felicity,<br>

But we go wrong full often truely.<br>

Thus we may sayen all, and namely* I,                        *especially<br>

That ween'd*, and had a great opinion,                          *thought<br>

That if I might escape from prison<br>

Then had I been in joy and perfect heal,<br>

Where now I am exiled from my weal.<br>

Since that I may not see you, Emily,<br>

I am but dead; there is no remedy."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00234">Upon that other side, Palamon,<br>

When that he wist Arcita was agone,<br>

Much sorrow maketh, that the greate tower<br>

Resounded of his yelling and clamour<br>

Thou mayst, since thou hast wisdom and manhead*,       *manhood, courage<br>

Assemble all the folk of our kindred,<br>

For whom that I must needes lose my life.<br>

For as by way of possibility,<br>

Since thou art at thy large, of prison free,<br>

And art a lord, great is thine avantage,<br>

More than is mine, that sterve here in a cage.<br>

For I must weep and wail, while that I live,<br>

With all the woe that prison may me give,<br>

And when a beast is dead, he hath no pain;<br>

<p id="id00237">Now will I stent* of Palamon a lite**,                   *pause **little<br>

That is or shall be while the world may dure.<br>

His sleep, his meat, his drink is *him byraft*,    *taken away from him*<br>

His eyen hollow, grisly to behold,<br>

His hue sallow, and pale as ashes cold,<br>

And if he hearde song or instrument,<br>

Then would he weepen, he might not be stent*.                   *stopped<br>

So feeble were his spirits, and so low,<br>

And changed so, that no man coulde know<br>

And in his gear* for all the world he far'd              *behaviour &lt;19&gt;<br>

Engender'd of humours melancholic,<br>

Before his head in his cell fantastic.&lt;20&gt;<br>

Both habit and eke dispositioun,<br>

Of him, this woful lover Dan* Arcite.                         *Lord &lt;21&gt;<br>

Why should I all day of his woe indite?<br>

When he endured had a year or two<br>

This cruel torment, and this pain and woe,<br>

At Thebes, in his country, as I said,<br>

Upon a night in sleep as he him laid,<br>

Him thought how that the winged god Mercury<br>

Before him stood, and bade him to be merry.<br>

His sleepy yard* in hand he bare upright;                      *rod &lt;22&gt;<br>

A hat he wore upon his haires bright.<br>

Arrayed was this god (as he took keep*)                          *notice<br>

As he was when that Argus&lt;23&gt; took his sleep;<br>

And said him thus: "To Athens shalt thou wend*;                      *go<br>

There is thee shapen* of thy woe an end."               *fixed, prepared<br>

And with that word Arcite woke and start.<br>

"Now truely how sore that e'er me smart,"<br>

Quoth he, "to Athens right now will I fare.<br>

Nor for no dread of death shall I not spare<br>

To see my lady that I love and serve;<br>

In her presence *I recke not to sterve.*"         *do not care if I die*<br>

And with that word he caught a great mirror,<br>

And saw that changed was all his colour,<br>

And saw his visage all in other kind.<br>

And right anon it ran him ill his mind,<br>

That since his face was so disfigur'd<br>

Of malady the which he had endur'd,<br>

He mighte well, if that he *bare him low,*      *lived in lowly fashion*<br>

Live in Athenes evermore unknow,<br>

And see his lady wellnigh day by day.<br>

And right anon he changed his array,<br>

And clad him as a poore labourer.<br>

And all alone, save only a squier,<br>

That knew his privity* and all his cas**,             *secrets **fortune<br>

Which was disguised poorly as he was,<br>

To Athens is he gone the nexte*  way.                      *nearest &lt;24&gt;<br>

And to the court he went upon a day,<br>

And at the gate he proffer'd his service,<br>

To drudge and draw, what so men would devise*.                    *order<br>

And, shortly of this matter for to sayn,<br>

He fell in office with a chamberlain,<br>

The which that dwelling was with Emily.<br>

For he was wise, and coulde soon espy<br>

Of every servant which that served her.<br>

Well could he hewe wood, and water bear,<br>

For he was young and mighty for the nones*,                    *occasion<br>

And thereto he was strong and big of bones<br>

To do that any wight can him devise.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00239">A year or two he was in this service,<br>

Page of the chamber of Emily the bright;<br>

And Philostrate he saide that he hight.<br>

But half so well belov'd a man as he<br>

Ne was there never in court of his degree.<br>

He was so gentle of conditioun,<br>

That throughout all the court was his renown.<br>

They saide that it were a charity<br>

That Theseus would *enhance his degree*,           *elevate him in rank*<br>

And put him in some worshipful service,<br>

There as he might his virtue exercise.<br>

And thus within a while his name sprung<br>

Both of his deedes, and of his good tongue,<br>

That Theseus hath taken him so near,<br>

That of his chamber he hath made him squire,<br>

And gave him gold to maintain his degree;<br>

And eke men brought him out of his country<br>

From year to year full privily his rent.<br>

But honestly and slyly* he it spent,              *discreetly, prudently<br>

It fell that in the seventh year, in May<br>

The thirde night (as olde bookes sayn,<br>

Were it by a venture or destiny<br>

(As when a thing is shapen* it shall be),              *settled, decreed<br>

That soon after the midnight, Palamon<br>

By helping of a friend brake his prison,<br>

Of a clary &lt;25&gt;, made of a certain wine,<br>

That all the night, though that men would him shake,<br>

The gaoler slept, he mighte not awake:<br>

And thus he fled as fast as ever he may.<br>

The night was short, and *faste by the day            *close at hand was<br>

That needes cast he must himself to hide*.          the day during which<br>

And to a grove faste there beside       he must cast about, or contrive,<br>

With dreadful foot then stalked Palamon.            to conceal himself.*<br>

For shortly this was his opinion,<br>

That in the grove he would him hide all day,<br>

And in the night then would he take his way<br>

To Thebes-ward, his friendes for to pray<br>

On Theseus to help him to warray*.                        *make war &lt;26&gt;<br>

And shortly either he would lose his life,<br>

Or winnen Emily unto his wife.<br>

This is th' effect, and his intention plain.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00241">Now will I turn to Arcita again,<br>

That little wist how nighe was his care,<br>

Till that Fortune had brought him in the snare.<br>

The busy lark, the messenger of day,<br>

Saluteth in her song the morning gray;<br>

And fiery Phoebus riseth up so bright,<br>

That all the orient laugheth at the sight,<br>

And with his streames* drieth in the greves**             *rays **groves<br>

The silver droppes, hanging on the leaves;<br>

And Arcite, that is in the court royal<br>

With Theseus, his squier principal,<br>

Is ris'n, and looketh on the merry day.<br>

And for to do his observance to May,<br>

Remembering the point* of his desire,                            *object<br>

He on his courser, starting as the fire,<br>

Is ridden to the fieldes him to play,<br>

Out of the court, were it a mile or tway.<br>

And to the grove, of which I have you told,<br>

By a venture his way began to hold,<br>

To make him a garland of the greves*,                            *groves<br>

Were it of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves,<br>

And loud he sang against the sun so sheen*.              *shining bright<br>

"O May, with all thy flowers and thy green,<br>

Right welcome be thou, faire freshe May,<br>

I hope that I some green here getten may."<br>

And from his courser*, with a lusty heart,                        *horse<br>

Into the grove full hastily he start,<br>

And in a path he roamed up and down,<br>

There as by aventure this Palamon<br>

Was in a bush, that no man might him see,<br>

For sore afeard of his death was he.<br>

Nothing ne knew he that it was Arcite;<br>

God wot he would have *trowed it full lite*.   *full little believed it*<br>

But sooth is said, gone since full many years,<br>

The field hath eyen*, and the wood hath ears,                      *eyes<br>

It is full fair a man *to bear him even*,           *to be on his guard*<br>

For all day meeten men at *unset steven*.          *unexpected time &lt;27&gt;<br>

Full little wot Arcite of his fellaw,<br>

That was so nigh to hearken of his saw*,                 *saying, speech<br>

For in the bush he sitteth now full still.<br>

When that Arcite had roamed all his fill,<br>

And *sungen all the roundel* lustily,           *sang the roundelay*&lt;28&gt;<br>

Into a study he fell suddenly,<br>

As do those lovers in their *quainte gears*,              *odd fashions*<br>

Now in the crop*, and now down in the breres**, &lt;29&gt;           *tree-top<br>

Now up, now down, as bucket in a well.                          **briars<br>

Right as the Friday, soothly for to tell,<br>

Now shineth it, and now it raineth fast,<br>

Right so can geary* Venus overcast                            *changeful<br>

The heartes of her folk, right as her day<br>

Is gearful*, right so changeth she array.                     *changeful<br>

Seldom is Friday all the weeke like.<br>

When Arcite had y-sung, he gan to sike*,                           *sigh<br>

And sat him down withouten any more:<br>

"Alas!" quoth he, "the day that I was bore!<br>

How longe, Juno, through thy cruelty<br>

Wilt thou warrayen* Thebes the city?                            *torment<br>

Alas! y-brought is to confusion<br>

The blood royal of Cadm' and Amphion:<br>

Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man,<br>

That Thebes built, or first the town began,<br>

And of the city first was crowned king.<br>

Of his lineage am I, and his offspring<br>

By very line, as of the stock royal;<br>

And now I am *so caitiff and so thrall*,         *wretched and enslaved*<br>

That he that is my mortal enemy,<br>

I serve him as his squier poorely.<br>

And yet doth Juno me well more shame,<br>

For I dare not beknow* mine owen name,                 *acknowledge &lt;30&gt;<br>

But there as I was wont to hight Arcite,<br>

Now hight I Philostrate, not worth a mite.<br>

Alas! thou fell Mars, and alas! Juno,<br>

Thus hath your ire our lineage all fordo*                *undone, ruined<br>

Save only me, and wretched Palamon,<br>

That Theseus martyreth in prison.<br>

And over all this, to slay me utterly,<br>

Love hath his fiery dart so brenningly*                       *burningly<br>

Y-sticked through my true careful heart,<br>

That shapen was my death erst than my shert. &lt;31&gt;<br>

Ye slay me with your eyen, Emily;<br>

Ye be the cause wherefore that I die.<br>

Of all the remnant of mine other care<br>

Ne set I not the *mountance of a tare*,               *value of a straw*<br>

So that I could do aught to your pleasance."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00242">And with that word he fell down in a trance<br>

A longe time; and afterward upstart<br>

This Palamon, that thought thorough his heart<br>

He felt a cold sword suddenly to glide:<br>

For ire he quoke*, no longer would he hide.                      *quaked<br>

And when that he had heard Arcite's tale,<br>

As he were wood*, with face dead and pale,                          *mad<br>

He start him up out of the bushes thick,<br>

And said: "False Arcita, false traitor wick'*,                   *wicked<br>

Now art thou hent*, that lov'st my lady so,                      *caught<br>

For whom that I have all this pain and woe,<br>

And art my blood, and to my counsel sworn,<br>

As I full oft have told thee herebeforn,<br>

And hast bejaped* here Duke Theseus,             *deceived, imposed upon<br>

And falsely changed hast thy name thus;<br>

I will be dead, or elles thou shalt die.<br>

Thou shalt not love my lady Emily,<br>

But I will love her only and no mo';<br>

For I am Palamon thy mortal foe.<br>

And though I have no weapon in this place,<br>

But out of prison am astart* by grace,                          *escaped<br>

I dreade* not that either thou shalt die,                         *doubt<br>

Or else thou shalt not loven Emily.<br>

Choose which thou wilt, for thou shalt not astart."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00243">This Arcite then, with full dispiteous* heart,                 *wrathful<br>

When he him knew, and had his tale heard,<br>

As fierce as lion pulled out a swerd,<br>

And saide thus; "By God that sitt'th above,<br>

*N'ere it* that thou art sick, and wood for love,          *were it not*<br>

And eke that thou no weap'n hast in this place,<br>

Thou should'st never out of this grove pace,<br>

That thou ne shouldest dien of mine hand.<br>

For I defy the surety and the band,<br>

Which that thou sayest I have made to thee.<br>

What? very fool, think well that love is free;<br>

And I will love her maugre* all thy might.                      *despite<br>

But, for thou art a worthy gentle knight,<br>

And *wilnest to darraine her by bataille*,             *will reclaim her<br>

And meat and drinke this night will I bring<br>

Enough for thee, and clothes for thy bedding.<br>

And if so be that thou my lady win,<br>

And slay me in this wood that I am in,<br>

Thou may'st well have thy lady as for me."<br>

This Palamon answer'd, "I grant it thee."<br>

And thus they be departed till the morrow,<br>

When each of them hath *laid his faith to borrow*.   *pledged his faith*<br>

Will not, *his thanks*, have any fellowship.             *thanks to him*<br>

Well finden that Arcite and Palamon.<br>

Arcite is ridd anon unto the town,<br>

And on the morrow, ere it were daylight,<br>

Full privily two harness hath he dight*,                       *prepared<br>

Both suffisant and meete to darraine*                           *contest<br>

The battle in the field betwixt them twain.<br>

And on his horse, alone as he was born,<br>

He carrieth all this harness him beforn;<br>

And in the grove, at time and place y-set,<br>

This Arcite and this Palamon be met.<br>

Then change gan the colour of their face;<br>

Right as the hunter in the regne* of Thrace                     *kingdom<br>

That standeth at a gappe with a spear<br>

When hunted is the lion or the bear,<br>

And heareth him come rushing in the greves*,                     *groves<br>

And breaking both the boughes and the leaves,<br>

Thinketh, "Here comes my mortal enemy,<br>

Withoute fail, he must be dead or I;<br>

For either I must slay him at the gap;<br>

Or he must slay me, if that me mishap:"<br>

So fared they, in changing of their hue<br>

*As far as either of them other knew*.        *When they recognised each<br>

There was no good day, and no saluting,                  other afar off*<br>

But straight, withoute wordes rehearsing,<br>

Evereach of them holp to arm the other,<br>

As friendly, as he were his owen brother.<br>

And after that, with sharpe speares strong<br>

They foined* each at other wonder long.                          *thrust<br>

Thou mightest weene*, that this Palamon                           *think<br>

In fighting were as a wood* lion,                                   *mad<br>

And as a cruel tiger was Arcite:<br>

As wilde boars gan they together smite,<br>

That froth as white as foam, *for ire wood*.            *mad with anger*<br>

Up to the ancle fought they in their blood.<br>

And in this wise I let them fighting dwell,<br>

And forth I will of Theseus you tell.<br>

This mean I now by mighty Theseus,<br>

That for to hunten is so desirous —<br>

And namely* the greate hart in May —                        *especially<br>

To be himself the greate harte's bane*                      *destruction<br>

For after Mars he serveth now Diane.<br>

Clear was the day, as I have told ere this,<br>

And Theseus, with alle joy and bliss,<br>

With his Hippolyta, the faire queen,<br>

And Emily, y-clothed all in green,<br>

On hunting be they ridden royally.<br>

And to the grove, that stood there faste by,<br>

In which there was an hart, as men him told,<br>

Duke Theseus the straighte way doth hold,<br>

And to the laund* he rideth him full right,                  *plain &lt;33&gt;<br>

With houndes, such as him lust* to command.                     *pleased<br>

And when this Duke was come to the laund,<br>

Under the sun he looked, and anon<br>

He was ware of Arcite and Palamon,<br>

That foughte breme*, as it were bulles two.                    *fiercely<br>

The brighte swordes wente to and fro<br>

So hideously, that with the leaste stroke<br>

It seemed that it woulde fell an oak,<br>

But what they were, nothing yet he wote*.                          *knew<br>

This Duke his courser with his spurres smote,<br>

*And at a start* he was betwixt them two,                     *suddenly*<br>

And pulled out a sword and cried, "Ho!<br>

No more, on pain of losing of your head.<br>

By mighty Mars, he shall anon be dead<br>

That smiteth any stroke, that I may see!<br>

But tell to me what mister* men ye be,                *manner, kind &lt;34&gt;<br>

That be so hardy for to fighte here<br>

Withoute judge or other officer,<br>

As though it were in listes royally. &lt;35&gt;<br>

This Palamon answered hastily,<br>

And saide: "Sir, what needeth wordes mo'?<br>

We have the death deserved bothe two,<br>

Two woful wretches be we, and caitives,<br>

That be accumbered* of our own lives,                          *burdened<br>

And as thou art a rightful lord and judge,<br>

So give us neither mercy nor refuge.<br>

And slay me first, for sainte charity,<br>

But slay my fellow eke as well as me.<br>

Or slay him first; for, though thou know it lite*,               *little<br>

This is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite<br>

That from thy land is banisht on his head,<br>

For this is he that came unto thy gate<br>

And saide, that he highte Philostrate.<br>

Thus hath he japed* thee full many year,                       *deceived<br>

And thou hast made of him thy chief esquier;<br>

And this is he, that loveth Emily.<br>

For since the day is come that I shall die<br>

Therefore I aske death and my jewise*.                        *judgement<br>

But slay my fellow eke in the same wise,<br>

For both we have deserved to be slain."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00246">This worthy Duke answer'd anon again,<br>

And said, "This is a short conclusion.<br>

Your own mouth, by your own confession<br>

Hath damned you, and I will it record;<br>

It needeth not to pain you with the cord;<br>

Ye shall be dead, by mighty Mars the Red.&lt;37&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00247">The queen anon for very womanhead<br>

Began to weep, and so did Emily,<br>

And all the ladies in the company.<br>

Great pity was it as it thought them all,<br>

That ever such a chance should befall,<br>

For gentle men they were, of great estate,<br>

And nothing but for love was this debate<br>

They saw their bloody woundes wide and sore,<br>

And cried all at once, both less and more,<br>

"Have mercy, Lord, upon us women all."<br>

And on their bare knees adown they fall<br>

And would have kissed his feet there as he stood,<br>

Till at the last *aslaked was his mood*                   *his anger was<br>

(For pity runneth soon in gentle heart);                       appeased*<br>

And though at first for ire he quoke and start<br>

He hath consider'd shortly in a clause<br>

The trespass of them both, and eke the cause:<br>

And although that his ire their guilt accused<br>

Yet in his reason he them both excused;<br>

As thus; he thoughte well that every man<br>

Will help himself in love if that he can,<br>

And eke deliver himself out of prison.<br>

Of women, for they wepten ever-in-one:*                     *continually<br>

And eke his hearte had compassion<br>

And in his gentle heart he thought anon,<br>

And soft unto himself he saide: "Fie<br>

Upon a lord that will have no mercy,<br>

But be a lion both in word and deed,<br>

To them that be in repentance and dread,<br>

As well as-to a proud dispiteous* man                         *unpitying<br>

That lord hath little of discretion,<br>

But weigheth pride and humbless *after one*."                    *alike*<br>

And shortly, when his ire is thus agone,<br>

He gan to look on them with eyen light*,               *gentle, lenient*<br>

Who looketh lightly now but Palamon?<br>

Who springeth up for joye but Arcite?<br>

Who could it tell, or who could it indite,<br>

The joye that is maked in the place<br>

When Theseus hath done so fair a grace?<br>

But down on knees went every *manner wight*,            *kind of person*<br>

And thanked him with all their heartes' might,<br>

And namely* these Thebans *ofte sithe*.         *especially *oftentimes*<br>

And thus with good hope and with hearte blithe<br>

They take their leave, and homeward gan they ride<br>

To Thebes-ward, with his old walles wide.<br>

<p id="id00250">I trow men woulde deem it negligence,<br>

If I forgot to telle the dispence*                          *expenditure<br>

Of Theseus, that went so busily<br>

To maken up the listes royally,<br>

Eastward there stood a gate of marble white,<br>

Westward right such another opposite.<br>

And, shortly to conclude, such a place<br>

Was never on earth made in so little space,<br>

For in the land there was no craftes-man,<br>

That geometry or arsmetrike* can**,                   *arithmetic **knew<br>

Nor pourtrayor*, nor carver of images,                 *portrait painter<br>

The theatre to make and to devise.<br>

And for to do his rite and sacrifice<br>

He eastward hath upon the gate above,<br>

In worship of Venus, goddess of love,<br>

*Done make* an altar and an oratory;                 *caused to be made*<br>

And westward, in the mind and in memory<br>

Of Mars, he maked hath right such another,<br>

That coste largely of gold a fother*.                    *a great amount<br>

Of alabaster white and red coral<br>

An oratory riche for to see,<br>

In worship of Diane of chastity,<br>

Hath Theseus done work in noble wise.<br>

But yet had I forgotten to devise*                             *describe<br>

Like to the estres* of the grisly place               *interior chambers<br>

In thilke* cold and frosty region,                                 *that<br>

There as Mars hath his sovereign mansion.<br>

In which there dwelled neither man nor beast,<br>

With knotty gnarry* barren trees old                            *gnarled<br>

Of stubbes sharp and hideous to behold;<br>

In which there ran a rumble and a sough*,                *groaning noise<br>

As though a storm should bursten every bough:<br>

And downward from an hill under a bent*                           *slope<br>

There stood the temple of Mars Armipotent,<br>

Wrought all of burnish'd steel, of which th' entry<br>

Was long and strait, and ghastly for to see.<br>

And thereout came *a rage and such a vise*,       *such a furious voice*<br>

That it made all the gates for to rise.<br>

The northern light in at the doore shone,<br>

For window on the walle was there none<br>

Through which men mighten any light discern.<br>

The doors were all of adamant etern,<br>

Y-clenched *overthwart and ende-long*         *crossways and lengthways*<br>

With iron tough, and, for to make it strong,<br>

Every pillar the temple to sustain<br>

Was tunne-great*, of iron bright and sheen.     *thick as a tun (barrel)<br>

There saw I first the dark imagining<br>

Of felony, and all the compassing;<br>

The cruel ire, as red as any glede*,                          *live coal<br>

The picke-purse&lt;45&gt;, and eke the pale dread;<br>

The nail y-driven in the shode* at night,         *hair of the head &lt;47&gt;<br>

The colde death, with mouth gaping upright.<br>

Amiddes of the temple sat Mischance,<br>

With discomfort and sorry countenance;<br>

Eke saw I Woodness* laughing in his rage,                       *Madness<br>

Armed Complaint, Outhees*, and fierce Outrage;                   *Outcry<br>

A thousand slain, and not *of qualm y-storve*;        *dead of sickness*<br>

The hunter strangled with the wilde bears:<br>

The sow freting* the child right in the cradle;          *devouring &lt;49&gt;<br>

The cook scalded, for all his longe ladle.<br>

Nor was forgot, *by th'infortune of Mart*        *through the misfortune<br>

The carter overridden with his cart;                             of war*<br>

Under the wheel full low he lay adown.<br>

The armourer, the bowyer*, and the smith,                 *maker of bows<br>

That forgeth sharp swordes on his stith*.                         *anvil<br>

With thilke* sharpe sword over his head                            *that<br>

Of cruel Nero, and Antonius:<br>

Although at that time they were yet unborn,<br>

Yet was their death depainted there beforn,<br>

By menacing of Mars, right by figure,<br>

So was it showed in that portraiture,<br>

As is depainted in the stars above,<br>

Who shall be slain, or elles dead for love.<br>

And over his head there shone two figures<br>

Of starres, that be cleped in scriptures,<br>

That one Puella, that other Rubeus. &lt;51&gt;<br>

This god of armes was arrayed thus:<br>

A wolf there stood before him at his feet<br>

The voice of the people touched the heaven,<br>

So loude cried they with merry steven*:                           *sound<br>

Scratching of cheeks, and rending eke of hair.<br>

"Why wouldest thou be dead?" these women cry,<br>

"And haddest gold enough, and Emily."<br>

No manner man might gladden Theseus,<br>

Saving his olde father Egeus,<br>

Death is an end of every worldly sore."<br>

Of good Arcite may best y-maked be,<br>

And eke most honourable in his degree.<br>

And at the last he took conclusion,<br>

That there as first Arcite and Palamon<br>

Hadde for love the battle them between,<br>

That in that selve* grove, sweet and green,                   *self-same<br>

After a bier, and it all oversprad<br>

With cloth of gold, the richest that he had;<br>

And of the same suit he clad Arcite.<br>

Upon his handes were his gloves white,<br>

Eke on his head a crown of laurel green,<br>

And in his hand a sword full bright and keen.<br>

He laid him *bare the visage* on the bier,         *with face uncovered*<br>

Therewith he wept, that pity was to hear.<br>

And, for the people shoulde see him all,<br>

When it was day he brought them to the hall,<br>

That roareth of the crying and the soun'.<br>

Then came this woful Theban, Palamon,<br>

With sluttery beard, and ruggy ashy hairs,&lt;85&gt;<br>

In clothes black, y-dropped all with tears,<br>

And (passing over weeping Emily)<br>

Then is it best, as for a worthy fame,<br>

For gentle mercy *oweth to passen right*."          *ought to be rightly<br>

Then said he thus to Palamon the knight;                       directed*<br>

"I trow there needeth little sermoning<br>

To make you assente to this thing.<br>

Come near, and take your lady by the hand."<br>

Betwixte them was made anon the band,<br>

That hight matrimony or marriage,<br>

By all the counsel of the baronage.<br>

And thus with alle bliss and melody<br>

Hath Palamon y-wedded Emily.<br>

And God, that all this wide world hath wrought,<br>

Send him his love, that hath it dearly bought.<br>

For now is Palamon in all his weal,<br>

Living in bliss, in riches, and in heal*.                        *health<br>

That never was there worde them between<br>

Of jealousy, nor of none other teen*.                    *cause of anger<br>

Thus endeth Palamon and Emily<br>

And God save all this faire company.<br>

<p id="id00280" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to The Knight's Tale.</p>

<p id="id00281" style="margin-top: 2em">1. For the plan and principal incidents of the "Knight's Tale,"
Chaucer was indebted to Boccaccio, who had himself borrowed
from some prior poet, chronicler, or romancer.  Boccaccio
speaks of the story as "very ancient;" and, though that may not
be proof of its antiquity, it certainly shows that he took it from
an earlier writer. The "Tale" is more or less a paraphrase of
Boccaccio's "Theseida;" but in some points the copy has a
distinct dramatic superiority over the original.  The "Theseida"
contained ten thousand lines; Chaucer has condensed it into less
than one-fourth of the number. The "Knight's Tale" is supposed
to have been at first composed as a separate work; it is
undetermined whether Chaucer took it direct from the Italian of
Boccaccio, or from a French translation.</p>

<p id="id00282">2. Highte: was called; from the Anglo-Saxon "hatan", to bid or
call; German, "Heissen", "heisst".</p>

<p id="id00283">3. Feminie: The "Royaume des Femmes" — kingdom of the
Amazons. Gower, in the "Confessio Amantis," styles
Penthesilea the "Queen of Feminie."</p>

<p id="id00284">4. Wonnen: Won, conquered; German "gewonnen."</p>

<p id="id00285">5. Ear: To plough; Latin, "arare."  "I have abundant  matter for
discourse." The first, and half of the second, of Boccaccio's
twelve books are disposed of in the few lines foregoing.</p>

<p id="id00286">6. Waimenting:  bewailing; German, "wehklagen"</p>

<p id="id00287">7. Starf: died; German, "sterben," "starb".</p>

<p id="id00288">8. The Minotaur: The monster, half-man and half-bull, which
yearly devoured a tribute of fourteen Athenian youths and
maidens, until it was slain by Theseus.</p>

<p id="id00289">9. Pillers: pillagers, strippers; French, "pilleurs."</p>

<p id="id00290">10. The donjon was originally the central tower or "keep" of
feudal castles; it was employed to detain prisoners of
importance. Hence the modern meaning of the word dungeon.</p>

<p id="id00291">11. Saturn, in the old astrology, was a most unpropitious star to
be born under.</p>

<p id="id00292">12. To die in the pain was a proverbial expression in the French,
used as an alternative to enforce a resolution or a promise.
Edward III., according to Froissart, declared that he would
either succeed in the war against France or die in the pain —
"Ou il mourroit en la peine." It was the fashion in those times to
swear oaths of friendship and brotherhood; and hence, though
the fashion has long died out, we still speak of "sworn friends."</p>

<p id="id00293">13. The saying of the old scholar Boethius, in his treatise "De
Consolatione Philosophiae", which Chaucer translated, and
from which he has freely borrowed in his poetry. The words are
"Quis legem det amantibus?
Major lex amor est sibi."
("Who can give law to lovers? Love is a law unto himself, and
greater")</p>

<p id="id00294">14. "Perithous" and "Theseus" must, for the metre, be
pronounced as words of four and three syllables respectively —
the vowels at the end not being diphthongated, but enunciated
separately, as if the words were printed Pe-ri-tho-us, The-se-us.
The same rule applies in such words as "creature" and
"conscience," which are trisyllables.</p>

<p id="id00295">15. Stound: moment, short space of time; from Anglo-Saxon,
"stund;" akin to which is German, "Stunde," an hour.</p>

<p id="id00296">16. Meinie: servants, or menials, &amp;c., dwelling together in a
house; from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning a crowd. Compare
German, "Menge," multitude.</p>

<p id="id00297">17. The pure fetters: the very fetters. The Greeks used
"katharos", the Romans "purus," in the same sense.</p>

<p id="id00298">18. In the medieval courts of Love, to which allusion is
probably made forty lines before, in the word "parlement," or
"parliament," questions like that here proposed were seriously
discussed.</p>

<p id="id00299">19. Gear: behaviour, fashion, dress; but, by another reading, the
word is "gyre," and means fit, trance — from the Latin, "gyro," I
turn round.</p>

<p id="id00300">20. Before his head in his cell fantastic: in front of his head in
his cell of fantasy. "The division of the brain into cells,
according to the different sensitive faculties," says Mr Wright,
"is very ancient, and is found depicted in mediaeval
manuscripts." In a manuscript in the Harleian Library, it is
stated, "Certum est in prora cerebri esse fantasiam, in medio
rationem discretionis, in puppi memoriam" (it is certain that in
the front of the brain is imagination, in the middle reason, in the
back memory) — a classification not materially differing from
that of modern phrenologists.</p>

<p id="id00301">21. Dan: Lord; Latin, "Dominus;" Spanish, "Don."</p>

<p id="id00302">22. The "caduceus."</p>

<p id="id00303">23. Argus was employed by Juno to watch Io with his hundred
eyes but he was sent to sleep by the flute of Mercury, who then
cut off his head.</p>

<p id="id00304">24. Next: nearest; German, "naechste".</p>

<p id="id00305">25. Clary: hippocras, wine made with spices.</p>

<p id="id00306">26. Warray: make war; French "guerroyer", to molest; hence,
perhaps, "to worry."</p>

<p id="id00307">27. All day meeten men at unset steven: every day men meet at
unexpected time.  "To  set a steven," is to fix a time, make an
appointment.</p>

<p id="id00308">28. Roundelay: song coming round again to the words with
which it opened.</p>

<p id="id00309">29. Now in the crop and now down in the breres: Now in the
tree-top, now down in the briars. "Crop and root," top and
bottom, is used to express the perfection or totality of anything.</p>

<p id="id00310">30. Beknow: avow, acknowledge: German, "bekennen."</p>

<p id="id00311">31. Shapen was my death erst than my shert: My death was
decreed before my shirt ws shaped — that is, before any clothes
were made for me, before my birth.</p>

<p id="id00312">32. Regne: Queen; French, "Reine;" Venus is meant. The
common reading, however, is "regne," reign or power.</p>

<p id="id00313">33. Launde: plain. Compare modern English, "lawn," and
French, "Landes" — flat, bare marshy tracts in the south of
France.</p>

<p id="id00314">34. Mister: manner, kind; German "muster," sample, model.</p>

<p id="id00315">35. In listes:  in the lists, prepared for such single combats
between champion and accuser, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00316">36. Thilke: that, contracted from "the ilke," the same.</p>

<p id="id00317">37. Mars the Red: referring to the ruddy colour of the planet, to
which was doubtless due the transference to it of the name of
the God of War. In his "Republic," enumerating the seven
planets, Cicero speaks of the propitious and beneficent light of
Jupiter: "Tum (fulgor) rutilis horribilisque terris, quem Martium
dicitis" —  "Then the red glow, horrible to the nations, which
you say to be that of Mars." Boccaccio opens the "Theseida" by
an invocation to "rubicondo Marte."</p>

<p id="id00318">38. Last: lace, leash, noose, snare: from Latin, "laceus."</p>

<p id="id00319">39. "Round was the shape, in manner of compass,
     Full of degrees, the height of sixty pas"
The building was a circle of steps or benches, as in the ancient
amphitheatre. Either the building was sixty paces high; or, more
probably, there were sixty of the steps or benches.</p>

<p id="id00320">40. Yellow goldes: The sunflower, turnsol, or girasol, which
turns with and seems to watch the sun, as a jealous lover his
mistress.</p>

<p id="id00321">41. Citheron: The Isle of Venus, Cythera, in the Aegean Sea;
now called Cerigo: not, as Chaucer's form of the word might
imply, Mount Cithaeron, in the south-west of Boetia, which was
appropriated to other deities than Venus — to Jupiter, to
Bacchus, and the Muses.</p>

<p id="id00322">42. It need not be said that Chaucer pays slight heed to
chronology in this passage, where the deeds of Turnus, the
glory of King Solomon, and the fate of Croesus are made
memories of the far past in the time of fabulous Theseus, the
Minotaur-slayer.</p>

<p id="id00323">43. Champartie: divided power or possession; an old law-term,
signifying the maintenance of a person in a law suit on the
condition of receiving part of the property in dispute, if
recovered.</p>

<p id="id00324">44. Citole: a kind of dulcimer.</p>

<p id="id00325">45. The picke-purse:  The plunderers that followed armies, and
gave to war a horror all their own.</p>

<p id="id00326">46. Shepen: stable;  Anglo-Saxon, "scypen;" the word
"sheppon" still survives in provincial parlance.</p>

<p id="id00327">47. This line, perhaps, refers to the deed of Jael.</p>

<p id="id00328">48. The shippes hoppesteres: The meaning is dubious. We may
understand "the dancing ships," "the ships that hop" on the
waves; "steres" being taken as the feminine adjectival
termination: or we may, perhaps, read, with one of the
manuscripts, "the ships upon the steres" — that is, even as they
are being steered, or on the open sea — a more picturesque
notion.</p>

<p id="id00329">49. Freting: devouring; the Germans use "Fressen" to mean
eating by animals, "essen" by men.</p>

<p id="id00330">50. Julius: i.e. Julius Caesar</p>

<p id="id00331">51. Puella and Rubeus were two figures in geomancy,
representing two constellations-the one signifying Mars
retrograde, the other Mars direct.</p>

<p id="id00332">52. Calistope: or Callisto, daughter of Lycaon, seduced by
Jupiter, turned into a bear by Diana, and placed afterwards, with
her son, as the Great Bear among the stars.</p>

<p id="id00333">53. Dane: Daphne, daughter of the river-god Peneus, in
Thessaly; she was beloved by Apollo, but to avoid his pursuit,
she was, at her own prayer, changed into a laurel-tree.</p>

<p id="id00334">54. As the goddess of Light, or the goddess who brings to light,
Diana — as well as Juno — was invoked by women in childbirth:
so Horace, Odes iii. 22, says:—</p>

<p id="id00335">"Montium custos nemorumque, Virgo,<br>

Quae laborantes utero puellas<br>

Ter vocata audis adimisque leto,<br>

Diva triformis."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00336">("Virgin custodian of hills and groves, three-formed goddess
who hears and saves from death young women who call upon
her thrice when in childbirth")</p>

<p id="id00337">55. Every deal:  in every part; "deal" corresponds to the
German "Theil" a portion.</p>

<p id="id00338">56. Sikerly: surely; German, "sicher;" Scotch, "sikkar," certain.
When Robert Bruce had escaped from England to assume the
Scottish crown, he stabbed Comyn before the altar at Dumfries;
and, emerging from the church, was asked by his friend
Kirkpatrick if he had slain the traitor. "I doubt it," said Bruce.
"Doubt," cried Kirkpatrick.  "I'll mak sikkar;" and he rushed
into the church, and despatched Comyn with repeated thrusts of
his dagger.</p>

<p id="id00339">57. Kemped: combed; the word survives in "unkempt."</p>

<p id="id00340">58. Alauns: greyhounds, mastiffs; from the Spanish word
"Alano," signifying a mastiff.</p>

<p id="id00341">59. Y-ment: mixed; German, "mengen," to mix.</p>

<p id="id00342">60. Prime: The time of early prayers, between six and nine in
the morning.</p>

<p id="id00343">61. On the dais: see note 32 to the Prologue.</p>

<p id="id00344">62. In her hour: in the hour of the day (two hours before
daybreak) which after the astrological system that divided the
twenty-four among the seven ruling planets, was under the
influence of Venus.</p>

<p id="id00345">63. Adon: Adonis, a beautiful youth beloved of Venus, whose
death by the tusk of a boar she deeply mourned.</p>

<p id="id00346">64. The third hour unequal: In the third planetary hour;
Palamon had gone forth in the hour of Venus, two hours before
daybreak; the hour of Mercury intervened; the third hour was
that of Luna, or Diana.  "Unequal" refers to the astrological
division of day and night, whatever their duration, into twelve
parts, which of necessity varied in length with the season.</p>

<p id="id00347">65. Smoking: draping; hence the word "smock;" "smokless," in
Chaucer, means naked.</p>

<p id="id00348">66. Cerrial: of the species of oak which Pliny, in his "Natural
History," calls "cerrus."</p>

<p id="id00349">67. Stace of Thebes: Statius, the Roman who embodied in the
twelve books of his "Thebaid" the ancient legends connected
with the war of the seven against Thebes.</p>

<p id="id00350">68. Diana was Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Hecate in
hell; hence the direction of the eyes of her statue to "Pluto's
dark region."  Her statue was set up where three ways met, so
that with a different face she looked down each of the three;
from which she was called Trivia. See the quotation from
Horace, note 54.</p>

<p id="id00351">69. Las: net; the invisible toils in which Hephaestus caught Ares
and the faithless Aphrodite, and exposed them to the
"inextinguishable laughter" of Olympus.</p>

<p id="id00352">70. Saturnus the cold: Here, as in "Mars the Red" we have the
person of the deity endowed with the supposed quality of the
planet called after his name.</p>

<p id="id00353">71. The astrologers ascribed great power to Saturn, and
predicted "much debate" under his ascendancy; hence it was
"against his kind" to compose the heavenly strife.</p>

<p id="id00354">72. Ayel: grandfather; French "Aieul".</p>

<p id="id00355">73. Testers: Helmets; from the French "teste", "tete", head.</p>

<p id="id00356">74. Parements: ornamental garb, French "parer" to deck.</p>

<p id="id00357">75. Gniding: Rubbing, polishing; Anglo-Saxon "gnidan", to rub.</p>

<p id="id00358">76. Nakeres: Drums, used in the cavalry; Boccaccio's word is
"nachere".</p>

<p id="id00359">77. Made an O: Ho! Ho! to command attention; like "oyez", the
call for silence in law-courts or before proclamations.</p>

<p id="id00360">78. Sarge: serge, a coarse woollen cloth</p>

<p id="id00361">79. Heart-spoon: The concave part of the breast, where the
lower ribs join the cartilago ensiformis.</p>

<p id="id00362">80. To-hewen and to-shred:  "to" before a verb implies
extraordinary violence in the action denoted.</p>

<p id="id00363">81. He through the thickest of the throng etc.. "He" in this
passage refers impersonally to any of the combatants.</p>

<p id="id00364">82. Galaphay: Galapha, in Mauritania.</p>

<p id="id00365">83. Belmarie is supposed to have been a Moorish state in
Africa; but "Palmyrie" has been suggested as the correct
reading.</p>

<p id="id00366">84. As I came never I cannot telle where: Where it went I
cannot tell you, as I was not there.  Tyrwhitt thinks that
Chaucer is sneering at Boccacio's pompous account of the
passage of Arcite's soul to heaven. Up to this point, the
description of the death-scene is taken literally from the
"Theseida."</p>

<p id="id00367">85. With sluttery beard, and ruggy ashy hairs: With neglected
beard, and rough hair strewn with ashes. "Flotery" is the general
reading; but "sluttery" seems to be more in keeping with the
picture of abandonment to grief.</p>

<p id="id00368">86. Master street: main street; so Froissart speaks of "le
souverain carrefour."</p>

<p id="id00369">87. Y-wrie: covered, hid; Anglo-Saxon, "wrigan," to veil.</p>

<p id="id00370">88. Emily applied the funeral torch. The "guise" was, among the
ancients, for the nearest relative of the deceased to do this, with
averted face.</p>

<p id="id00371">89. It was the custom for soldiers to march thrice around the
funeral pile of an emperor or general; "on the left hand" is
added, in reference to the belief that the left hand was
propitious — the Roman augur turning his face southward, and
so placing on his left hand the east, whence good omens came.
With the Greeks, however, their augurs facing the north, it was
just the contrary. The confusion, frequent in classical writers, is
complicated here by the fact that Chaucer's description of the
funeral of Arcite is taken from Statius' "Thebaid" — from a
Roman's account of a Greek solemnity.</p>

<p id="id00372">90. Lyke-wake: watching by the remains of the dead; from
Anglo-Saxon, "lice," a corpse; German, "Leichnam."</p>

<p id="id00373">91. Chaucer here borrows from Boethius, who says:
"Hanc rerum seriem ligat,
Terras ac pelagus regens,
Et coelo imperitans, amor."
(Love ties these things together: the earth, and the ruling sea,
and the imperial heavens)</p>

<h4 id="id00375" style="margin-top: 2em">THE PROLOGUE.</h4>

<p id="id00376" style="margin-top: 2em">When that the Knight had thus his tale told<br>

In all the rout was neither young nor old,<br>

That he not said it was a noble story,<br>

And worthy to be *drawen to memory*;                          *recorded*<br>

And *namely the gentles* every one.          *especially the gentlefolk*<br>

Our Host then laugh'd and swore, "So may I gon,*                *prosper<br>

This goes aright; *unbuckled is the mail;*        *the budget is opened*<br>

Let see now who shall tell another tale:<br>

For truely this game is well begun.<br>

Now telleth ye, Sir Monk, if that ye conne*,                       *know<br>

Somewhat, to quiten* with the Knighte's tale."                    *match<br>

The Miller that fordrunken was all pale,<br>

So that unnethes* upon his horse he sat,                *with difficulty<br>

He would avalen* neither hood nor hat,                          *uncover<br>

Nor abide* no man for his courtesy,                         *give way to<br>

But in Pilate's voice&lt;1&gt; he gan to cry,<br>

And swore by armes, and by blood, and bones,<br>

"I can a noble tale for the nones*                            *occasion,<br>

With which I will now quite* the Knighte's tale."                 *match<br>

Our Host saw well how drunk he was of ale,<br>

And said; "Robin, abide, my leve* brother,                         *dear<br>

Some better man shall tell us first another:<br>

Abide, and let us worke thriftily."<br>

By Godde's soul," quoth he, "that will not I,<br>

For I will speak, or elles go my way!"<br>

Our Host answer'd; "*Tell on a devil way*;             *devil take you!*<br>

Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome."<br>

"Now hearken," quoth the Miller, "all and some:<br>

But first I make a protestatioun.<br>

That I am drunk, I know it by my soun':<br>

And therefore if that I misspeak or say,<br>

*Wite it* the ale of Southwark, I you pray:             *blame it on*&lt;2&gt;<br>

For I will tell a legend and a life<br>

Both of a carpenter and of his wife,<br>

How that a clerk hath *set the wrighte's cap*."   *fooled the carpenter*<br>

The Reeve answer'd and saide, "*Stint thy clap*,      *hold your tongue*<br>

Let be thy lewed drunken harlotry.<br>

It is a sin, and eke a great folly<br>

To apeiren* any man, or him defame,                              *injure<br>

And eke to bringe wives in evil name.<br>

Thou may'st enough of other thinges sayn."<br>

This drunken Miller spake full soon again,<br>

And saide, "Leve brother Osewold,<br>

Who hath no wife, he is no cuckold.<br>

But I say not therefore that thou art one;<br>

There be full goode wives many one.<br>

Why art thou angry with my tale now?<br>

I have a wife, pardie, as well as thou,<br>

Yet *n'old I*, for the oxen in my plough,                  *I would not*<br>

Taken upon me more than enough,<br>

To deemen* of myself that I am one;                               *judge<br>

I will believe well that I am none.<br>

An husband should not be inquisitive<br>

Of Godde's privity, nor of his wife.<br>

So he may finde Godde's foison* there,                         *treasure<br>

Of the remnant needeth not to enquere."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00377">What should I more say, but that this Millere<br>

He would his wordes for no man forbear,<br>

But told his churlish* tale in his mannere;               *boorish, rude<br>

Me thinketh, that I shall rehearse it here.<br>

And therefore every gentle wight I pray,<br>

For Godde's love to deem not that I say<br>

Of evil intent, but that I must rehearse<br>

Their tales all, be they better or worse,<br>

Or elles falsen* some of my mattere.                            *falsify<br>

And therefore whoso list it not to hear,<br>

Turn o'er the leaf, and choose another tale;<br>

For he shall find enough, both great and smale,<br>

Of storial* thing that toucheth gentiless,             *historical, true<br>

And eke morality and holiness.<br>

Blame not me, if that ye choose amiss.<br>

The Miller is a churl, ye know well this,<br>

So was the Reeve, with many other mo',<br>

And harlotry* they tolde bothe two.                        *ribald tales<br>

*Avise you* now, and put me out of blame;                    *be warned*<br>

And eke men should not make earnest of game*.                 *jest, fun<br>
</p>

<p id="id00378" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Miller's Tale</p>

<p id="id00379">1. Pilate, an unpopular personage in the mystery-plays of the
middle ages, was probably represented as having a gruff, harsh
voice.</p>

<p id="id00380">2. Wite: blame; in Scotland, "to bear the wyte," is to bear the
blame.</p>

<h4 id="id00381" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE.</h4>

<p id="id00382" style="margin-top: 2em">Whilom there was dwelling in Oxenford<br>

A riche gnof*, that *guestes held to board*,   *miser *took in boarders*<br>

And of his craft he was a carpenter.<br>

With him there was dwelling a poor scholer,<br>

Had learned art, but all his fantasy<br>

Was turned for to learn astrology.<br>

He coude* a certain of conclusions                                 *knew<br>

To deeme* by interrogations,                                  *determine<br>

If that men asked him in certain hours,<br>

When that men should have drought or elles show'rs:<br>

Or if men asked him what shoulde fall<br>

Of everything, I may not reckon all.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00383">This clerk was called Hendy* Nicholas;                 *gentle, handsome<br>

Of derne* love he knew and of solace;                   *secret, earnest<br>

And therewith he was sly and full privy,<br>

And like a maiden meek for to see.<br>

A chamber had he in that hostelry<br>

Alone, withouten any company,<br>

Full *fetisly y-dight* with herbes swoot*,            *neatly decorated*<br>

And he himself was sweet as is the root                           *sweet<br>

Of liquorice, or any setewall*.                                *valerian<br>

His Almagest,&lt;1&gt; and bookes great and small,<br>

His astrolabe,&lt;2&gt;  belonging to his art,<br>

His augrim stones,&lt;3&gt; layed fair apart<br>

On shelves couched* at his bedde's head,                      *laid, set<br>

His press y-cover'd with a falding* red.                   *coarse cloth<br>

And all above there lay a gay psalt'ry<br>

On which he made at nightes melody,<br>

So sweetely, that all the chamber rang:<br>

And Angelus ad virginem&lt;4&gt; he sang.<br>

And after that he sung the kinge's note;<br>

Full often blessed was his merry throat.<br>

And thus this sweete clerk his time spent<br>

After *his friendes finding and his rent.*    *Attending to his friends,<br>

                                                   and providing for the<br>

                                                    cost of his lodging*<br>

This carpenter had wedded new a wife,<br>

Which that he loved more than his life:<br>

Of eighteen year, I guess, she was of age.<br>

Jealous he was, and held her narr'w in cage,<br>

For she was wild and young, and he was old,<br>

And deemed himself belike* a cuckold.                           *perhaps<br>

He knew not Cato,&lt;5&gt; for his wit was rude,<br>

That bade a man wed his similitude.<br>

Men shoulde wedden after their estate,<br>

For youth and eld* are often at debate.                             *age<br>

But since that he was fallen in the snare,<br>

He must endure (as other folk) his care.<br>

Fair was this younge wife, and therewithal<br>

As any weasel her body gent* and small.                      *slim, neat<br>

A seint* she weared, barred all of silk,                         *girdle<br>

A barm-cloth* eke as white as morning milk                     *apron&lt;6&gt;<br>

Upon her lendes*, full of many a gore**.                  *loins **plait<br>

White was her smock*, and broider'd all before,            *robe or gown<br>

And eke behind, on her collar about<br>

Of coal-black silk, within and eke without.<br>

The tapes of her white volupere*                      *head-kerchief &lt;7&gt;<br>

Were of the same suit of her collere;<br>

Her fillet broad of silk, and set full high:<br>

And sickerly* she had a likerous** eye.          *certainly **lascivious<br>

Full small y-pulled were her browes two,<br>

And they were bent*, and black as any sloe.                      *arched<br>

She was well more *blissful on to see*           *pleasant to look upon*<br>

Than is the newe perjenete* tree;                       *young pear-tree<br>

And softer than the wool is of a wether.<br>

And by her girdle hung a purse of leather,<br>

Tassel'd with silk, and *pearled with latoun*.   *set with brass pearls*<br>

In all this world to seeken up and down<br>

There is no man so wise, that coude thenche*            *fancy, think of<br>

So gay a popelot*, or such a wench.                          *puppet &lt;8&gt;<br>

Full brighter was the shining of her hue,<br>

Than in the Tower the noble* forged new.                *a gold coin &lt;9&gt;<br>

But of her song, it was as loud and yern*,                  *lively &lt;10&gt;<br>

As any swallow chittering on a bern*.                              *barn<br>

Thereto* she coulde skip, and *make a game*                 *also *romp*<br>

As any kid or calf following his dame.<br>

Her mouth was sweet as braket,&lt;11&gt; or as methe*                    *mead<br>

Or hoard of apples, laid in hay or heath.<br>

Wincing* she was as is a jolly colt,                           *skittish<br>

Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.<br>

A brooch she bare upon her low collere,<br>

As broad as is the boss of a bucklere.<br>

Her shoon were laced on her legges high;<br>

She was a primerole,* a piggesnie &lt;12&gt;,                        *primrose<br>

For any lord t' have ligging* in his bed,                         *lying<br>

Or yet for any good yeoman to wed.<br>

<p id="id00384">Now, sir, and eft* sir, so befell the case,                       *again<br>

That on a day this Hendy Nicholas<br>

Fell with this younge wife to rage* and play,       *toy, play the rogue<br>

While that her husband was at Oseney,&lt;13&gt;<br>

As clerkes be full subtle and full quaint.<br>

And privily he caught her by the queint,*                          *cunt<br>

And said; "Y-wis,* but if I have my will,                     *assuredly<br>

For *derne love of thee, leman, I spill."*     *for earnest love of thee<br>

And helde her fast by the haunche bones,          my mistress, I perish*<br>

And saide "Leman, love me well at once,<br>

Or I will dien, all so God me save."<br>

And she sprang as a colt doth in the trave&lt;14&gt;:<br>

And with her head she writhed fast away,<br>

And said; "I will not kiss thee, by my fay*.                      *faith<br>

Why let be," quoth she, "let be, Nicholas,<br>

Or I will cry out harow and alas!&lt;15&gt;<br>

Do away your handes, for your courtesy."<br>

This Nicholas gan mercy for to cry,<br>

And spake so fair, and proffer'd him so fast,<br>

That she her love him granted at the last,<br>

And swore her oath by Saint Thomas of Kent,<br>

That she would be at his commandement,<br>

When that she may her leisure well espy.<br>

"My husband is so full of jealousy,<br>

That but* ye waite well, and be privy,                           *unless<br>

I wot right well I am but dead," quoth she.<br>

"Ye muste be full derne* as in this case."                       *secret<br>

"Nay, thereof care thee nought," quoth Nicholas:<br>

"A clerk had *litherly beset his while*,            *ill spent his time*<br>

*But if* he could a carpenter beguile."                          *unless<br>

And thus they were accorded and y-sworn<br>

To wait a time, as I have said beforn.<br>

When Nicholas had done thus every deal*,                           *whit<br>

And thwacked her about the lendes* well,                          *loins<br>

He kiss'd her sweet, and taketh his psalt'ry<br>

And playeth fast, and maketh melody.<br>

Then fell it thus, that to the parish church,<br>

Of Christe's owen workes for to wirch*,                            *work<br>

This good wife went upon a holy day;<br>

Her forehead shone as bright as any day,<br>

So was it washen, when she left her werk.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00385">Now was there of that church a parish clerk,<br>

The which that was y-cleped Absolon.<br>

Curl'd was his hair, and as the gold it shone,<br>

And strutted* as a fanne large and broad;                     *stretched<br>

Full straight and even lay his jolly shode*.               *head of hair<br>

His rode* was red, his eyen grey as goose,                   *complexion<br>

With Paule's windows carven on his shoes &lt;16&gt;<br>

In hosen red he went full fetisly*.                    *daintily, neatly<br>

Y-clad he was full small and properly,<br>

All in a kirtle* of a light waget*;                   *girdle **sky blue<br>

Full fair and thicke be the pointes set,<br>

And thereupon he had a gay surplice,<br>

As white as is the blossom on the rise*.                      *twig &lt;17&gt;<br>

A merry child he was, so God me save;<br>

Well could he letten blood, and clip, and shave,<br>

And make a charter of land, and a quittance.<br>

In twenty manners could he trip and dance,<br>

After the school of Oxenforde tho*,&lt;18&gt;                            *then<br>

And with his legges caste to and fro;<br>

And playen songes on a small ribible*;                           *fiddle<br>

Thereto he sung sometimes a loud quinible*                       *treble<br>

And as well could he play on a gitern.*                          *guitar<br>

In all the town was brewhouse nor tavern,<br>

That he not visited with his solas*,                       *mirth, sport<br>

There as that any *garnard tapstere* was.           *licentious barmaid*<br>

But sooth to say he was somedeal squaimous*                   *squeamish<br>

Of farting, and of speeche dangerous.<br>

This Absolon, that jolly was and gay,<br>

Went with a censer on the holy day,<br>

Censing* the wives of the parish fast;              *burning incense for<br>

And many a lovely look he on them cast,<br>

And namely* on this carpenter's wife:                        *especially<br>

To look on her him thought a merry life.<br>

She was so proper, and sweet, and likerous.<br>

I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,<br>

And he a cat, he would *her hent anon*.           *have soon caught her*<br>

This parish clerk, this jolly Absolon,<br>

Hath in his hearte such a love-longing!<br>

That of no wife took he none offering;<br>

For courtesy he said he woulde none.<br>

The moon at night full clear and brighte shone,<br>

And Absolon his gitern hath y-taken,<br>

For paramours he thoughte for to waken,<br>

And forth he went, jolif* and amorous,                           *joyous<br>

Till he came to the carpentere's house,<br>

A little after the cock had y-crow,<br>

And *dressed him* under a shot window &lt;19&gt;,         *stationed himself.*<br>

That was upon the carpentere's wall.<br>

He singeth in his voice gentle and small;<br>

"Now, dear lady, if thy will be,<br>

I pray that ye will rue* on me;"                              *take pity<br>

Full well accordant to his giterning.<br>

This carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,<br>

And spake unto his wife, and said anon,<br>

What Alison, hear'st thou not Absolon,<br>

That chanteth thus under our bower* wall?"                      *chamber<br>

And she answer'd her husband therewithal;<br>

"Yes, God wot, John, I hear him every deal."<br>

This passeth forth; what will ye bet* than well?                 *better<br>
</p>

<p id="id00386">From day to day this jolly Absolon<br>

So wooeth her, that him is woebegone.<br>

He waketh all the night, and all the day,<br>

To comb his lockes broad, and make him gay.<br>

He wooeth her *by means and by brocage*,     *by presents and by agents*<br>

And swore he woulde be her owen page.<br>

He singeth brokking* as a nightingale.                        *quavering<br>

He sent her piment &lt;20&gt;, mead, and spiced ale,<br>

And wafers* piping hot out of the glede**:                *cakes **coals<br>

And, for she was of town, he proffer'd meed.&lt;21&gt;<br>

For some folk will be wonnen for richess,<br>

And some for strokes, and some with gentiless.<br>

Sometimes, to show his lightness and mast'ry,<br>

He playeth Herod &lt;22&gt; on a scaffold high.<br>

But what availeth him as in this case?<br>

So loveth she the Hendy Nicholas,<br>

That Absolon may *blow the bucke's horn*:                 *"go whistle"*<br>

He had for all his labour but a scorn.<br>

And thus she maketh Absolon her ape,<br>

And all his earnest turneth to a jape*.                            *jest<br>

Full sooth is this proverb, it is no lie;<br>

Men say right thus alway; the nighe sly<br>

Maketh oft time the far lief to be loth. &lt;23&gt;<br>

For though that Absolon be wood* or wroth                           *mad<br>

Because that he far was from her sight,<br>

This nigh Nicholas stood still in his light.<br>

Now bear thee well, thou Hendy Nicholas,<br>

For Absolon may wail and sing "Alas!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id00387">And so befell, that on a Saturday<br>

This carpenter was gone to Oseney,<br>

And Hendy Nicholas and Alison<br>

Accorded were to this conclusion,<br>

That Nicholas shall *shape him a wile*              *devise a stratagem*<br>

The silly jealous husband to beguile;<br>

And if so were the game went aright,<br>

She shoulde sleepen in his arms all night;<br>

For this was her desire and his also.<br>

And right anon, withoute wordes mo',<br>

This Nicholas no longer would he tarry,<br>

But doth full soft unto his chamber carry<br>

Both meat and drinke for a day or tway.<br>

And to her husband bade her for to say,<br>

If that he asked after Nicholas,<br>

She shoulde say, "She wist* not where he was;                      *knew<br>

Of all the day she saw him not with eye;<br>

She trowed* he was in some malady,                             *believed<br>

For no cry that her maiden could him call<br>

He would answer, for nought that might befall."<br>

Thus passed forth all thilke* Saturday,                            *that<br>

That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,<br>

And ate, and slept, and didde what him list<br>

Till Sunday, that* the sunne went to rest.                         *when<br>

This silly carpenter *had great marvaill*             *wondered greatly*<br>

Of Nicholas, or what thing might him ail,<br>

And said; "I am adrad*, by Saint Thomas!               *afraid, in dread<br>

It standeth not aright with Nicholas:<br>

*God shielde* that he died suddenly.                    *heaven forbid!*<br>

This world is now full fickle sickerly*.                      *certainly<br>

I saw to-day a corpse y-borne to chirch,<br>

That now on Monday last I saw him wirch*.                          *work<br>

"Go up," quod he unto his knave*, "anon;                       *servant.<br>

Clepe* at his door, or knocke with a stone:                        *call<br>

Look how it is, and tell me boldely."<br>

This knave went him up full sturdily,<br>

And, at the chamber door while that he stood,<br>

He cried and knocked as that he were wood:*                         *mad<br>

"What how? what do ye, Master Nicholay?<br>

How may ye sleepen all the longe day?"<br>

But all for nought, he hearde not a word.<br>

An hole he found full low upon the board,<br>

Where as the cat was wont in for to creep,<br>

And at that hole he looked in full deep,<br>

And at the last he had of him a sight.<br>

This Nicholas sat ever gaping upright,<br>

As he had kyked* on the newe moon.                          *looked &lt;24&gt;<br>

Adown he went, and told his master soon,<br>

In what array he saw this ilke* man.                               *same<br>
</p>

<p id="id00388">This carpenter to *blissen him* began,            *bless, cross himself*<br>

And said: "Now help us, Sainte Frideswide.&lt;25&gt;<br>

A man wot* little what shall him betide.                          *knows<br>

This man is fall'n with his astronomy<br>

Into some woodness* or some agony.                              *madness<br>

I thought aye well how that it shoulde be.<br>

Men should know nought of Godde's privity*.                     *secrets<br>

Yea, blessed be alway a lewed* man,                           *unlearned<br>

That *nought but only his believe can*.                   *knows no more<br>

So far'd another clerk with astronomy:                than his "credo."*<br>

He walked in the fieldes for to *pry<br>

Upon* the starres, what there should befall,             *keep watch on*<br>

Till he was in a marle pit y-fall.&lt;26&gt;<br>

He saw not that. But yet, by Saint Thomas!<br>

*Me rueth sore of*  Hendy Nicholas:                *I am very sorry for*<br>

He shall be *rated of* his studying,                       *chidden for*<br>

If that I may, by Jesus, heaven's king!<br>

Get me a staff, that I may underspore*                         *lever up<br>

While that thou, Robin, heavest off the door:<br>

He shall out of his studying, as I guess."<br>

And to the chamber door he gan him dress*                *apply himself.<br>

His knave was a strong carl for the nonce,<br>

And by the hasp he heav'd it off at once;<br>

Into the floor the door fell down anon.<br>

This Nicholas sat aye as still as stone,<br>

And ever he gap'd upward into the air.<br>

The carpenter ween'd* he were in despair,                       *thought<br>

And hent* him by the shoulders mightily,                         *caught<br>

And shook him hard, and cried spitously;*                       *angrily<br>

"What, Nicholas? what how, man? look adown:<br>

Awake, and think on Christe's passioun.<br>

I crouche thee&lt;27&gt; from elves, and from wights*.                *witches<br>

Therewith the night-spell said he anon rights*,                *properly<br>

On the four halves* of the house about,                         *corners<br>

And on the threshold of the door without.<br>

"Lord Jesus Christ, and Sainte Benedight,<br>

Blesse this house from every wicked wight,<br>

From the night mare, the white Pater-noster;<br>

Where wonnest* thou now, Sainte Peter's sister?"               *dwellest<br>

And at the last this Hendy Nicholas<br>

Gan for to sigh full sore, and said; "Alas!<br>

Shall all time world be lost eftsoones* now?"                 *forthwith<br>

This carpenter answer'd; "What sayest thou?<br>

What? think on God, as we do, men that swink.*"                  *labour<br>

This Nicholas answer'd; "Fetch me a drink;<br>

And after will I speak in privity<br>

Of certain thing that toucheth thee and me:<br>

I will tell it no other man certain."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00389">This carpenter went down, and came again,<br>

And brought of mighty ale a large quart;<br>

And when that each of them had drunk his part,<br>

This Nicholas his chamber door fast shet*,                         *shut<br>

And down the carpenter by him he set,<br>

And saide; "John, mine host full lief* and dear,                  *loved<br>

Thou shalt upon thy truthe swear me here,<br>

That to no wight thou shalt my counsel wray*:                    *betray<br>

For it is Christes counsel that I say,<br>

And if thou tell it man, thou art forlore:*                    *lost&lt;28&gt;<br>

For this vengeance thou shalt have therefor,<br>

That if thou wraye* me, thou shalt be wood**."             *betray **mad<br>

"Nay, Christ forbid it for his holy blood!"<br>

Quoth then this silly man; "I am no blab,*                       *talker<br>

Nor, though I say it, am I *lief to gab*.               *fond of speech*<br>

Say what thou wilt, I shall it never tell<br>

To child or wife, by him that harried Hell."                        &lt;29&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00390">"Now, John," quoth Nicholas, "I will not lie,<br>

I have y-found in my astrology,<br>

As I have looked in the moone bright,<br>

That now on Monday next, at quarter night,<br>

Shall fall a rain, and that so wild and wood*,                      *mad<br>

That never half so great was Noe's flood.<br>

This world," he said, "in less than half an hour<br>

Shall all be dreint*, so hideous is the shower:                 *drowned<br>

Thus shall mankinde drench*, and lose their life."                *drown<br>

This carpenter answer'd; "Alas, my wife!<br>

And shall she drench? alas, mine Alisoun!"<br>

For sorrow of this he fell almost adown,<br>

And said; "Is there no remedy in this case?"<br>

"Why, yes, for God," quoth Hendy Nicholas;<br>

"If thou wilt worken after *lore and rede*;        *learning and advice*<br>

Thou may'st not worken after thine own head.<br>

For thus saith Solomon, that was full true:<br>

Work all by counsel, and thou shalt not rue*.                    *repent<br>

And if thou worke wilt by good counseil,<br>

I undertake, withoute mast or sail,<br>

Yet shall I save her, and thee, and me.<br>

Hast thou not heard how saved was Noe,<br>

When that our Lord had warned him beforn,<br>

That all the world with water *should be lorn*?"         *should perish*<br>

"Yes," quoth this carpenter," *full yore ago*."             *long since*<br>

"Hast thou not heard," quoth Nicholas, "also<br>

The sorrow of Noe, with his fellowship,<br>

That he had ere he got his wife to ship?&lt;30&gt;<br>

*Him had been lever, I dare well undertake,<br>

At thilke time, than all his wethers black,<br>

That she had had a ship herself alone.*                   *see note &lt;31&gt;<br>

And therefore know'st thou what is best to be done?<br>

This asketh haste, and of an hasty thing<br>

Men may not preach or make tarrying.<br>

Anon go get us fast into this inn*                                *house<br>

A kneading trough, or else a kemelin*,                      *brewing-tub<br>

For each of us; but look that they be large,<br>

In whiche we may swim* as in a barge:                             *float<br>

And have therein vitaille suffisant<br>

But for one day; fie on the remenant;<br>

The water shall aslake* and go away                      *slacken, abate<br>

Aboute prime* upon the nexte day.                         *early morning<br>

But Robin may not know of this, thy knave*,                     *servant<br>

Nor eke thy maiden Gill I may not save:<br>

Ask me not why: for though thou aske me<br>

I will not telle Godde's privity.<br>

Sufficeth thee, *but if thy wit be mad*,                 *unless thou be<br>

To have as great a grace as Noe had;                    out of thy wits*<br>

Thy wife shall I well saven out of doubt.<br>

Go now thy way, and speed thee hereabout.<br>

But when thou hast for her, and thee, and me,<br>

Y-gotten us these kneading tubbes three,<br>

Then shalt thou hang them in the roof full high,<br>

So that no man our purveyance* espy:              *foresight, providence<br>

And when thou hast done thus as I have said,<br>

And hast our vitaille fair in them y-laid,<br>

And eke an axe to smite the cord in two<br>

When that the water comes, that we may go,<br>

And break an hole on high upon the gable<br>

Into the garden-ward, over the stable,<br>

That we may freely passe forth our way,<br>

When that the greate shower is gone away.<br>

Then shalt thou swim as merry, I undertake,<br>

As doth the white duck after her drake:<br>

Then will I clepe,* 'How, Alison? How, John?                       *call<br>

Be merry: for the flood will pass anon.'<br>

And thou wilt say, 'Hail, Master Nicholay,<br>

Good-morrow, I see thee well, for it is day.'<br>

And then shall we be lordes all our life<br>

Of all the world, as Noe and his wife.<br>

But of one thing I warne thee full right,<br>

Be well advised, on that ilke* night,                              *same<br>

When we be enter'd into shippe's board,<br>

That none of us not speak a single word,<br>

Nor clepe nor cry, but be in his prayere,<br>

For that is Godde's owen heste* dear.                           *command<br>

Thy wife and thou must hangen far atween*,                      *asunder<br>

For that betwixte you shall be no sin,<br>

No more in looking than there shall in deed.<br>

This ordinance is said: go, God thee speed<br>

To-morrow night, when men be all asleep,<br>

Into our kneading tubbes will we creep,<br>

And sitte there, abiding Godde's grace.<br>

Go now thy way, I have no longer space<br>

To make of this no longer sermoning:<br>

Men say thus: Send the wise, and say nothing:<br>

Thou art so wise, it needeth thee nought teach.<br>

Go, save our lives, and that I thee beseech."<br>

To drenchen* Alison, his honey dear.                              *drown<br>

He weepeth, waileth, maketh *sorry cheer*;          *dismal countenance*<br>

He sigheth, with full many a sorry sough.*                        *groan<br>

He go'th, and getteth him a kneading trough,<br>

And after that a tub, and a kemelin,<br>

And privily he sent them to his inn:<br>

And hung them in the roof full privily.<br>

With his own hand then made he ladders three,<br>

To climbe by *the ranges and the stalks*    *the rungs and the uprights*<br>

Unto the tubbes hanging in the balks*;                            *beams<br>

And victualed them, kemelin, trough, and tub,<br>

With bread and cheese, and good ale in a jub*,                      *jug<br>

Sufficing right enough as for a day.<br>

But ere that he had made all this array,<br>

He sent his knave*, and eke his wench** also,            *servant **maid<br>

Upon his need* to London for to go.                            *business<br>

And on the Monday, when it drew to night,<br>

He shut his door withoute candle light,<br>

And dressed* every thing as it should be.                      *prepared<br>

And shortly up they climbed all the three.<br>

They satte stille well *a furlong way*.          *the time it would take<br>

"Now, Pater noster, clum,"&lt;32&gt; said Nicholay,         to walk a furlong*<br>

And "clum," quoth John; and "clum," said Alison:<br>

This carpenter said his devotion,<br>

And still he sat and bidded his prayere,<br>

Awaking on the rain, if he it hear.<br>

The deade sleep, for weary business,<br>

Fell on this carpenter, right as I guess,<br>

About the curfew-time,&lt;33&gt; or little more,<br>

For *travail of his ghost* he groaned sore,          *anguish of spirit*<br>

*And eft he routed, for his head mislay.*           *and then he snored,<br>

Adown the ladder stalked Nicholay;                for his head lay awry*<br>

And Alison full soft adown she sped.<br>

Withoute wordes more they went to bed,<br>

*There as* the carpenter was wont to lie:                        *where*<br>

There was the revel, and the melody.<br>

And thus lay Alison and Nicholas,<br>

In business of mirth and in solace,<br>

Until the bell of laudes* gan to ring,       *morning service, at 3.a.m.<br>

And friars in the chancel went to sing.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00392">This parish clerk, this amorous Absolon,<br>

That is for love alway so woebegone,<br>

Upon the Monday was at Oseney<br>

With company, him to disport and play;<br>

And asked upon cas* a cloisterer**                      *occasion **monk<br>

Full privily after John the carpenter;<br>

And he drew him apart out of the church,<br>

And said, "I n'ot;* I saw him not here wirch**          *know not **work<br>

Since Saturday; I trow that he be went<br>

For timber, where our abbot hath him sent.<br>

And dwellen at the Grange a day or two:<br>

For he is wont for timber for to go,<br>

Or else he is at his own house certain.<br>

Where that he be, I cannot *soothly sayn.*"              *say certainly*<br>

This Absolon full jolly was and light,<br>

And thought, "Now is the time to wake all night,<br>

For sickerly* I saw him not stirring                          *certainly<br>

About his door, since day began to spring.<br>

So may I thrive, but I shall at cock crow<br>

Full privily go knock at his window,<br>

That stands full low upon his bower* wall:                      *chamber<br>

To Alison then will I tellen all<br>

My love-longing; for I shall not miss<br>

That at the leaste way I shall her kiss.<br>

Some manner comfort shall I have, parfay*,                  *by my faith<br>

My mouth hath itched all this livelong day:<br>

That is a sign of kissing at the least.<br>

All night I mette* eke I was at a feast.                         *dreamt<br>

Therefore I will go sleep an hour or tway,<br>

And all the night then will I wake and play."<br>

When that the first cock crowed had, anon<br>

Up rose this jolly lover Absolon,<br>

And him arrayed gay, *at point devise.*                *with exact care*<br>

But first he chewed grains&lt;34&gt; and liquorice,<br>

To smelle sweet, ere he had combed his hair.<br>

Under his tongue a true love &lt;35&gt;  he bare,<br>

For thereby thought he to be gracious.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00393">Then came he to the carpentere's house,<br>

And still he stood under the shot window;<br>

Unto his breast it raught*, it was so low;                      *reached<br>

And soft he coughed with a semisoun'.*                         *low tone<br>

"What do ye, honeycomb, sweet Alisoun?<br>

My faire bird, my sweet cinamome*,                *cinnamon, sweet spice<br>

Awaken, leman* mine, and speak to me.                          *mistress<br>

Full little thinke ye upon my woe,<br>

That for your love I sweat *there as* I go.                    *wherever<br>

No wonder is that I do swelt* and sweat.                          *faint<br>

I mourn as doth a lamb after the teat<br>

Y-wis*, leman, I have such love-longing,                      *certainly<br>

That like a turtle* true is my mourning.                    *turtle-dove<br>

I may not eat, no more than a maid."<br>

"Go from the window, thou jack fool," she said:<br>

"As help me God, it will not be, 'come ba* me.'                    *kiss<br>

I love another, else I were to blame",<br>

Well better than thee, by Jesus, Absolon.<br>

Go forth thy way, or I will cast a stone;<br>

And let me sleep; *a twenty devil way*.         *twenty devils take ye!*<br>

"Alas!" quoth Absolon, "and well away!<br>

That true love ever was so ill beset:<br>

Then kiss me, since that it may be no bet*,                      *better<br>

For Jesus' love, and for the love of me."<br>

"Wilt thou then go thy way therewith?" , quoth she.<br>

"Yea, certes, leman," quoth this Absolon.<br>

"Then make thee ready," quoth she, "I come anon."<br>

[And unto Nicholas she said *full still*:               *in a low voice*<br>

"Now peace, and thou shalt laugh anon thy fill."]&lt;36&gt;<br>

This Absolon down set him on his knees,<br>

And said; "I am a lord at all degrees:<br>

For after this I hope there cometh more;<br>

Leman, thy grace, and, sweete bird, thine ore.*"                 *favour<br>

The window she undid, and that in haste.<br>

"Have done," quoth she, "come off, and speed thee fast,<br>

Lest that our neighebours should thee espy."<br>

Then Absolon gan wipe his mouth full dry.<br>

Dark was the night as pitch or as the coal,<br>

And at the window she put out her hole,<br>

And Absolon him fell ne bet ne werse,<br>

But with his mouth he kiss'd her naked erse<br>

Full savourly. When he was ware of this,<br>

Aback he start, and thought it was amiss;<br>

For well he wist a woman hath no beard.<br>

He felt a thing all rough, and long y-hair'd,<br>

And saide; "Fy, alas! what have I do?"<br>

"Te he!" quoth she, and clapt the window to;<br>

And Absolon went forth at sorry pace.<br>

"A beard, a beard," said Hendy Nicholas;<br>

"By God's corpus, this game went fair and well."<br>

This silly Absolon heard every deal*,                              *word<br>

And on his lip he gan for anger bite;<br>

And to himself he said, "I shall thee quite*.     *requite, be even with<br>

Who rubbeth now, who frotteth* now his lips                        *rubs<br>

With dust, with sand, with straw, with cloth, with chips,<br>

But Absolon? that saith full oft, "Alas!<br>

My soul betake I unto Sathanas,<br>

But me were lever* than all this town," quoth he                 *rather<br>

I this despite awroken* for to be.                             *revenged<br>

Alas! alas! that I have been y-blent*."                        *deceived<br>

His hote love is cold, and all y-quent.*                       *quenched<br>

For from that time that he had kiss'd her erse,<br>

Of paramours he *sette not a kers,*                   *cared not a rush*<br>

For he was healed of his malady;<br>

Full often paramours he gan defy,<br>

And weep as doth a child that hath been beat.<br>

A softe pace he went over the street<br>

Unto a smith, men callen Dan* Gerveis,                           *master<br>

That in his forge smithed plough-harness;<br>

He sharped share and culter busily.<br>

This Absolon knocked all easily,<br>

And said; "Undo, Gerveis, and that anon."<br>

"What, who art thou?" "It is I, Absolon."<br>

"What? Absolon, what? Christe's sweete tree*,                     *cross<br>

Why rise so rath*? hey! Benedicite,                               *early<br>

What aileth you? some gay girl,&lt;37&gt; God it wote,<br>

Hath brought you thus upon the viretote:&lt;38&gt;<br>

By Saint Neot, ye wot well what I mean."<br>

This Absolon he raughte* not a bean                       *recked, cared<br>

Of all his play; no word again he gaf*,                           *spoke<br>

For he had more tow on his distaff&lt;39&gt;<br>

Than Gerveis knew, and saide; "Friend so dear,<br>

That hote culter in the chimney here<br>

Lend it to me, I have therewith to don*:                             *do<br>

I will it bring again to thee full soon."<br>

Gerveis answered; "Certes, were it gold,<br>

Or in a poke* nobles all untold,                                  *purse<br>

Thou shouldst it have, as I am a true smith.<br>

Hey! Christe's foot, what will ye do therewith?"<br>

"Thereof," quoth Absolon, "be as be may;<br>

I shall well tell it thee another day:"<br>

And caught the culter by the colde stele*.                       *handle<br>

Full soft out at the door he gan to steal,<br>

And went unto the carpentere's wall<br>

He coughed first, and knocked therewithal<br>

Upon the window, light as he did ere*.                      *before &lt;40&gt;<br>

This Alison answered; "Who is there<br>

That knocketh so? I warrant him a thief."<br>

"Nay, nay," quoth he, "God wot, my sweete lefe*,                   *love<br>

I am thine Absolon, my own darling.<br>

Of gold," quoth he, "I have thee brought a ring,<br>

My mother gave it me, so God me save!<br>

Full fine it is, and thereto well y-grave*:                    *engraved<br>

This will I give to thee, if thou me kiss."<br>

Now Nicholas was risen up to piss,<br>

And thought he would *amenden all the jape*;          *improve the joke*<br>

He shoulde kiss his erse ere that he scape:<br>

And up the window did he hastily,<br>

And out his erse he put full privily<br>

Over the buttock, to the haunche bone.<br>

And therewith spake this clerk, this Absolon,<br>

"Speak, sweete bird, I know not where thou art."<br>

This Nicholas anon let fly a fart,<br>

As great as it had been a thunder dent*;                     *peal, clap<br>

That with the stroke he was well nigh y-blent*;                 *blinded<br>

But he was ready with his iron hot,<br>

And Nicholas amid the erse he smote.<br>

Off went the skin an handbreadth all about.<br>

The hote culter burned so his tout*,                             *breech<br>

That for the smart he weened* he would die;                     *thought<br>

As he were wood*, for woe he gan to cry,                            *mad<br>

"Help! water, water, help for Godde's heart!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id00394">This carpenter out of his slumber start,<br>

And heard one cry "Water," as he were wood*,                        *mad<br>

And thought, "Alas! now cometh Noe's flood."<br>

He sat him up withoute wordes mo'<br>

And with his axe he smote the cord in two;<br>

And down went all; he found neither to sell<br>

Nor bread nor ale, till he came to the sell*,            *threshold &lt;41&gt;<br>

Upon the floor, and there in swoon he lay.<br>

Up started Alison and Nicholay,<br>

And cried out an "harow!" &lt;15&gt;  in the street.<br>

The neighbours alle, bothe small and great<br>

In ranne, for to gauren* on this man,                             *stare<br>

That yet in swoone lay, both pale and wan:<br>

For with the fall he broken had his arm.<br>

But stand he must unto his owen harm,<br>

For when he spake, he was anon borne down<br>

With Hendy Nicholas and Alisoun.<br>

They told to every man that he was wood*;                           *mad<br>

He was aghaste* so of Noe's flood,                               *afraid<br>

Through phantasy, that of his vanity<br>

He had y-bought him kneading-tubbes three,<br>

And had them hanged in the roof above;<br>

And that he prayed them for Godde's love<br>

To sitten in the roof for company.<br>

The folk gan laughen at his phantasy.<br>

Into the roof they kyken* and they gape,                    *peep, look.<br>

And turned all his harm into a jape*.                              *jest<br>

For whatsoe'er this carpenter answer'd,<br>

It was for nought, no man his reason heard.<br>

With oathes great he was so sworn adown,<br>

That he was holden wood in all the town.<br>

For every clerk anon right held with other;<br>

They said, "The man was wood, my leve* brother;"                   *dear<br>

And every wight gan laughen at his strife.<br>

Thus swived* was the carpentere's wife,                         *enjoyed<br>

For all his keeping* and his jealousy;                             *care<br>

And Absolon hath kiss'd her nether eye;<br>

And Nicholas is scalded in the tout.<br>

This tale is done, and God save all the rout*.                  *company<br>

formed the canon of astrological science in the middle ages.</p>

<p id="id00397">2. Astrolabe:  "Astrelagour," "astrelabore"; a mathematical
instrument for taking the altitude of the sun or stars.</p>

<p id="id00398">3. "Augrim" is a corruption of algorithm, the Arabian term for
numeration; "augrim stones," therefore were probably marked
with numerals, and used as counters.</p>

28.  It was the "Ave Maria" of the Catholic Church service.</p>

<p id="id00400">5. Cato: Though Chaucer may have referred to the famous
Censor, more probably the reference is merely to the "Moral
Distichs," which go under his name, though written after his
time; and in a supplement to which the quoted passage may be
found.</p>

<p id="id00401">6. Barm-cloth: apron; from Anglo-Saxon "barme," bosom or
lap.</p>

<p id="id00402">7. Volupere: Head-gear, kerchief; from French, "envelopper,"

<p id="id00403">8. Popelet:  Puppet; but chiefly; young wench.</p>

<p id="id00404">9. Noble: nobles were gold coins of especial purity and
brightness; "Ex auro nobilissimi, unde nobilis vocatus," (made

In some parts of the country, a drink made from honeycomb,
after the honey is extracted, is still called "bragwort."</p>

<p id="id00407">12. Piggesnie: a fond term, like "my duck;" from Anglo-Saxon,
"piga," a young maid; but Tyrwhitt associates it with the Latin,
"ocellus," little eye, a fondling term, and suggests that the "pigs-
eye," which is very small, was  applied in the same sense.
Davenport and Butler both use the word pigsnie, the first for
"darling," the second literally for "eye;" and Bishop Gardner,
"On True Obedience," in his address to the reader, says: "How
softly she was wont to chirpe him under the chin, and kiss him;
how prettily she could talk to him (how doth my sweet heart,
what saith now pig's-eye)."</p>

reward, for her love.</p>

<p id="id00417">22. Parish-clerks, like Absolon, had leading parts in the
mysteries or religious plays; Herod was one of these parts,
which may have been an object of competition among the
amateurs of the period.</p>

<p id="id00418">23 ."The nighe sly maketh oft time the far lief to be loth": a
proverb; the cunning one near at hand oft makes the loving one
afar off to be odious.</p>

<p id="id00423">28. Forlore: lost; german, "verloren."</p>

<p id="id00424">29. Him that harried Hell: Christ who wasted or subdued hell: in
the middle ages, some very active exploits against the prince of
darkness and his powers were ascribed by the monkish tale-
tellers to the saviour after he had "descended into hell."</p>

<p id="id00425">30. According to the old mysteries, Noah's wife refused to
come into the ark, and bade her husband row forth and get him
a new wife, because he was leaving her gossips in the town to
drown. Shem and his brothers got her shipped by main force;
and Noah, coming forward to welcome her, was greeted with a
box on the ear.</p>

<p id="id00426">31. "Him had been lever, I dare well undertake,
     At thilke time, than all his wethers black,
     That she had had a ship herself alone."

had had an ark to herself."</p>

<p id="id00427">32. "Clum," like "mum," a note of silence; but otherwise
explained as the humming sound made in repeating prayers;
from the Anglo-Saxon, "clumian," to mutter, speak in an under-
tone, keep silence.</p>

<p id="id00428">33. Curfew-time: Eight in the evening, when, by the law of
William the Conqueror, all people were, on ringing of a bell, to
extinguish fire and candle, and go to rest; hence the word
curfew, from French, "couvre-feu," cover-fire.</p>

<p id="id00429">34. Absolon chewed grains: these were grains of Paris, or
Paradise; a favourite spice.</p>

<p id="id00430">35. Under his tongue a true love he bare:  some sweet herb;
another reading, however, is "a true love-knot," which may
have been of the nature of a charm.</p>

<p id="id00433">38. Viretote: Urry reads "meritote," and explains it from
Spelman as a game in which children made themselves giddy by
whirling on ropes.  In French, "virer" means to turn; and the
explanation may, therefore, suit either reading. In modern slang
parlance, Gerveis would probably have said, "on the rampage,"
or "on the swing" — not very far from Spelman's rendering.</p>

<p id="id00442" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Reeves Tale.</p>

<p id="id00443" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%"> 1. "With blearing of a proude miller's eye": dimming his eye;
playing off a joke on him.</p>

<p id="id00444">2. "Me list not play for age": age takes away my zest for
drollery.</p>

<p id="id00445">3. The medlar, the fruit of the mespilus tree, is only edible when
rotten.</p>

<p id="id00446">4. Yet in our ashes cold does fire reek: "ev'n in our ashes live
their wonted fires."</p>

<p id="id00447">5. A colt's tooth; a wanton humour, a relish for pleasure.</p>

<p id="id00448">6. Chimb: The rim of a barrel where the staves project beyond
the head.</p>

<p id="id00449">7. With olde folk, save dotage, is no more: Dotage is all that is
left them; that is, they can only dwell fondly, dote, on the past.</p>

<p id="id00450">8. Souter: cobbler; Scottice, "sutor;"' from Latin, "suere," to
sew.</p>

<p id="id00451">9. "Ex sutore medicus"  (a surgeon from a cobbler) and "ex
sutore nauclerus" (a  seaman or pilot from a cobbler) were both
proverbial expressions in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p id="id00452">10. Half past prime: half-way between prime and tierce; about
half-past seven in the morning.</p>

<p id="id00453">11. Set his hove; like "set their caps;" as in the description of
the Manciple in the Prologue, who "set their aller cap".  "Hove"
or "houfe," means "hood;" and the phrase signifies to be even
with, outwit.</p>

<p id="id00456" style="margin-top: 2em">At Trompington, not far from Cantebrig,*                      *Cambridge<br>

There goes a brook, and over that a brig,<br>

Upon the whiche brook there stands a mill:<br>

And this is *very sooth* that I you tell.               *complete truth*<br>

A miller was there dwelling many a day,<br>

As any peacock he was proud and gay:<br>

Pipen he could, and fish, and nettes bete*,                     *prepare<br>

And turne cups, and wrestle well, and shete*.                     *shoot<br>

Aye by his belt he bare a long pavade*,                         *poniard<br>

And of his sword full trenchant was the blade.<br>

A jolly popper* bare he in his pouch;                            *dagger<br>

There was no man for peril durst him touch.<br>

A Sheffield whittle* bare he in his hose.                   *small knife<br>

Round was his face, and camuse* was his nose.                  *flat &lt;2&gt;<br>

As pilled* as an ape's was his skull.                     *peeled, bald.<br>

He was a market-beter* at the full.                             *brawler<br>

There durste no wight hand upon him legge*,                         *lay<br>

That he ne swore anon he should abegge*.             *suffer the penalty<br>
</p>

<p id="id00457">A thief he was, for sooth, of corn and meal,<br>

And that a sly, and used well to steal.<br>

His name was *hoten deinous Simekin*        *called "Disdainful Simkin"*<br>

A wife he hadde, come of noble kin:<br>

The parson of the town her father was.<br>

With her he gave full many a pan of brass,<br>

For that Simkin should in his blood ally.<br>

She was y-foster'd in a nunnery:<br>

For Simkin woulde no wife, as he said,<br>

But she were well y-nourish'd, and a maid,<br>

To saven his estate and yeomanry:<br>

And she was proud, and pert as is a pie*.                        *magpie<br>

A full fair sight it was to see them two;<br>

On holy days before her would he go<br>

With his tippet* y-bound about his head;                           *hood<br>

And she came after in a gite* of red,                          *gown &lt;3&gt;<br>

And Simkin hadde hosen of the same.<br>

There durste no wight call her aught but Dame:<br>

None was so hardy, walking by that way,<br>

That with her either durste *rage or play*,                *use freedom*<br>

*But if* he would be slain by Simekin                            *unless<br>

With pavade, or with knife, or bodekin.<br>

For jealous folk be per'lous evermo':<br>

Algate* they would their wives *wende so*.           *unless *so behave*<br>

And eke for she was somewhat smutterlich*,                        *dirty<br>

She was as dign* as water in a ditch,                             *nasty<br>

And all so full of hoker*, and bismare**.   *ill-nature **abusive speech<br>

Her thoughte that a lady should her spare*,        *not judge her hardly<br>

What for her kindred, and her nortelrie*           *nurturing, education<br>

That she had learned in the nunnery.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00458">One daughter hadde they betwixt them two<br>

Of twenty year, withouten any mo,<br>

Saving a child that was of half year age,<br>

In cradle it lay, and was a proper page.*                           *boy<br>

This wenche thick and well y-growen was,<br>

With camuse* nose, and eyen gray as glass;                         *flat<br>

With buttocks broad, and breastes round and high;<br>

But right fair was her hair, I will not lie.<br>

The parson of the town, for she was fair,<br>

In purpose was to make of her his heir<br>

Both of his chattels and his messuage,<br>

And *strange he made it* of her marriage.           *he made it a matter<br>

His purpose was for to bestow her high                    of difficulty*<br>

Into some worthy blood of ancestry.<br>

For holy Church's good may be dispended*                          *spent<br>

On holy Church's blood that is descended.<br>

Therefore he would his holy blood honour<br>

Though that he holy Churche should devour.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00459">Great soken* hath this miller, out of doubt,    *toll taken for grinding<br>

With wheat and malt, of all the land about;<br>

And namely* there was a great college                        *especially<br>

Men call the Soler Hall at Cantebrege,&lt;4&gt;<br>

There was their wheat and eke their malt y-ground.<br>

And on a day it happed in a stound*,                           *suddenly<br>

Sick lay the manciple* of a malady,                         *steward &lt;5&gt;<br>

Men *weened wisly* that he shoulde die.              *thought certainly*<br>

For which this miller stole both meal and corn<br>

An hundred times more than beforn.<br>

For theretofore he stole but courteously,<br>

But now he was a thief outrageously.<br>

For which the warden chid and made fare*,                          *fuss<br>

But thereof *set the miller not a tare*;           *he cared not a rush*<br>

He *crack'd his boast,* and swore it was not so.            *talked big*<br>
</p>

<p id="id00460">Then were there younge poore scholars two,<br>

That dwelled in the hall of which I say;<br>

Testif* they were, and lusty for to play;                *headstrong &lt;6&gt;<br>

And only for their mirth and revelry<br>

Upon the warden busily they cry,<br>

To give them leave for but a *little stound*,               *short time*<br>

To go to mill, and see their corn y-ground:<br>

And hardily* they durste lay their neck,                         *boldly<br>

The miller should not steal them half a peck<br>

Of corn by sleight, nor them by force bereave*                *take away<br>

And at the last the warden give them leave:<br>

John hight the one, and Alein hight the other,<br>

Of one town were they born, that highte Strother,&lt;7&gt;<br>

Far in the North, I cannot tell you where.<br>

This Alein he made ready all his gear,<br>

And on a horse the sack he cast anon:<br>

Forth went Alein the clerk, and also John,<br>

With good sword and with buckler by their side.<br>

John knew the way, him needed not no guide,<br>

And at the mill the sack adown he lay'th.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00461">Alein spake first; "All hail, Simon, in faith,<br>

How fares thy faire daughter, and thy wife."<br>

"Alein, welcome," quoth Simkin, "by my life,<br>

And John also: how now, what do ye here?"<br>

"By God, Simon," quoth John, "need has no peer*.                  *equal<br>

Him serve himself behoves that has no swain*,                   *servant<br>

Or else he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.<br>

Our manciple I hope* he will be dead,                            *expect<br>

So workes aye the wanges* in his head:                  *cheek-teeth &lt;8&gt;<br>

And therefore is I come, and eke Alein,<br>

To grind our corn and carry it home again:<br>

I pray you speed us hence as well ye may."<br>

"It shall be done," quoth Simkin, "by my fay.<br>

What will ye do while that it is in hand?"<br>

"By God, right by the hopper will I stand,"<br>

Quoth John, "and see how that the corn goes in.<br>

Yet saw I never, by my father's kin,<br>

How that the hopper wagges to and fro."<br>

Alein answered, "John, and wilt thou so?<br>

Then will I be beneathe, by my crown,<br>

And see how that the meale falls adown<br>

Into the trough, that shall be my disport*:                   *amusement<br>

For, John, in faith I may be of your sort;<br>

I is as ill a miller as is ye."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00462">This miller smiled at their nicety*,                         *simplicity<br>

And thought, "All this is done but for a wile.<br>

They weenen* that no man may them beguile,                        *think<br>

But by my thrift yet shall I blear their eye,&lt;9&gt;<br>

For all the sleight in their philosophy.<br>

The more *quainte knackes* that they make,           *odd little tricks*<br>

The more will I steal when that I take.<br>

Instead of flour yet will I give them bren*.                       *bran<br>

The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,<br>

As whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare: &lt;10&gt;<br>

Of all their art ne count I not a tare."<br>

Out at the door he went full privily,<br>

When that he saw his time, softely.<br>

He looked up and down, until he found<br>

The clerkes' horse, there as he stood y-bound<br>

Behind the mill, under a levesell:*                          *arbour&lt;11&gt;<br>

And to the horse he went him fair and well,<br>

And stripped off the bridle right anon.<br>

And when the horse was loose, he gan to gon<br>

Toward the fen, where wilde mares run,<br>

Forth, with "Wehee!" through thick and eke through thin.<br>

This miller went again, no word he said,<br>

But did his note*, and with these clerkes play'd,         *business &lt;12&gt;<br>

Till that their corn was fair and well y-ground.<br>

And when the meal was sacked and y-bound,<br>

Then John went out, and found his horse away,<br>

And gan to cry, "Harow, and well-away!<br>

Our horse is lost: Alein, for Godde's bones,<br>

Step on thy feet; come off, man, all at once:<br>

Alas! our warden has his palfrey lorn.*"                           *lost<br>

This Alein all forgot, both meal and corn;<br>

All was out of his mind his husbandry*.              *careful watch over<br>

"What, which way is he gone?" he gan to cry.                   the corn*<br>

The wife came leaping inward at a renne*,                           *run<br>

She said; "Alas! your horse went to the fen<br>

With wilde mares, as fast as he could go.<br>

Unthank* come on his hand that bound him so           *ill luck, a curse<br>

And his that better should have knit the rein."<br>

"Alas!" quoth John, "Alein, for Christes pain<br>

Lay down thy sword, and I shall mine also.<br>

I is full wight*, God wate**, as is a roe.                *swift **knows<br>

By Godde's soul he shall not scape us bathe*.                 *both &lt;13&gt;<br>

Why n' had thou put the capel* in the lathe**?         *horse&lt;14&gt; **barn<br>

Ill hail, Alein, by God thou is a fonne.*"                         *fool<br>

These silly clerkes have full fast y-run<br>

Toward the fen, both Alein and eke John;<br>

And when the miller saw that they were gone,<br>

He half a bushel of their flour did take,<br>

And bade his wife go knead it in a cake.<br>

He said; I trow, the clerkes were afeard,<br>

Yet can a miller *make a clerkes beard,*          *cheat a scholar* &lt;15&gt;<br>

For all his art: yea, let them go their way!<br>

Lo where they go! yea, let the children play:<br>

They get him not so lightly, by my crown."<br>

These silly clerkes runnen up and down<br>

With "Keep, keep; stand, stand; jossa*, warderere.                 *turn<br>

Go whistle thou, and I shall keep* him here."                     *catch<br>

But shortly, till that it was very night<br>

They coulde not, though they did all their might,<br>

Their capel catch, he ran alway so fast:<br>

Till in a ditch they caught him at the last.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00463">Weary and wet, as beastes in the rain,<br>

Comes silly John, and with him comes Alein.<br>

"Alas," quoth John, "the day that I was born!<br>

Now are we driv'n till hething* and till scorn.                 *mockery<br>

Our corn is stol'n, men will us fonnes* call,                     *fools<br>

Thus plained John, as he went by the way<br>

Toward the mill, and Bayard* in his hand.                 *the bay horse<br>

Against my loss, I will have easement:<br>

This John answer'd;  Alein, *avise thee*:                  *have a care*<br>

The miller is a perilous man," he said,<br>

"And if that he out of his sleep abraid*,                        *awaked<br>

He mighte do us both a villainy*."                             *mischief<br>

Alein answer'd; "I count him not a fly.<br>

This wenche lay upright, and fast she slept,<br>

Till he so nigh was, ere she might espy,<br>

That it had been too late for to cry:<br>

And, shortly for to say, they were at one.<br>

Now play, Alein, for I will speak of John.<br>

<p id="id00466">This John lay still a furlong way &lt;23&gt; or two,<br>

And to himself he made ruth* and woe.                              *wail<br>

"Alas!" quoth he, "this is a wicked jape*;                        *trick<br>

Unto the cradle, and in his hand it hent*,                         *took<br>

And bare it soft unto his beddes feet.<br>

Soon after this the wife *her routing lete*,           *stopped snoring*<br>

And gan awake, and went her out to piss<br>

And came again and gan the cradle miss<br>

And groped here and there, but she found none.<br>

"Alas!" quoth she, "I had almost misgone<br>

I had almost gone to the clerkes' bed.<br>

Ey! Benedicite, then had I foul y-sped."<br>

And forth she went, till she the cradle fand.<br>

She groped alway farther with her hand<br>

And found the bed, and *thoughte not but good*        *had no suspicion*<br>

Because that the cradle by it stood,<br>

And wist not where she was, for it was derk;<br>

But fair and well she crept in by the clerk,<br>

And lay full still, and would have caught a sleep.<br>

Within a while this John the Clerk up leap<br>

And on this goode wife laid on full sore;<br>

So merry a fit had she not had *full yore*.            *for a long time*<br>

He pricked hard and deep, as he were mad.<br>

<p id="id00467">This jolly life have these two clerkes had,<br>

Till that the thirde cock began to sing.<br>

Alein wax'd weary in the morrowing,<br>

Thou shalt a cake of half a bushel find,<br>

Which that I help'd my father for to steal.<br>

And goode leman, God thee save and keep."<br>

And with that word she gan almost to weep.<br>

Alein uprose and thought, "Ere the day daw<br>

I will go creepen in by my fellaw:"<br>

And found the cradle with his hand anon.<br>

"By God!" thought he, "all wrong I have misgone:<br>

My head is *totty of my swink* to-night,          *giddy from my labour*<br>

That maketh me that I go not aright.<br>

I wot well by the cradle I have misgo';<br>

Here lie the miller and his wife also."<br>

And forth he went a twenty devil way<br>

Unto the bed, there as the miller lay.<br>

He ween'd* t' have creeped by his fellow John,                  *thought<br>

And by the miller in he crept anon,<br>

And caught him by the neck, and gan him shake,<br>

And said; "Thou John, thou swines-head, awake<br>

For Christes soul, and hear a noble game!<br>

For by that lord that called is Saint Jame,<br>

As I have thries in this shorte night<br>

Swived the miller's daughter bolt-upright,<br>

While thou hast as a coward lain aghast*."                       *afraid<br>

"Thou false harlot," quoth the miller, "hast?<br>

Ah, false traitor, false clerk," quoth he,<br>

"Thou shalt be dead, by Godde's dignity,<br>

Who durste be so bold to disparage*                            *disgrace<br>

And on the nose he smote him with his fist;<br>

Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast:<br>

And in the floor with nose and mouth all broke<br>

They wallow, as do two pigs in a poke.<br>

And up they go, and down again anon,<br>

Till that the miller spurned* on a stone,                      *stumbled<br>

And down he backward fell upon his wife,<br>

That wiste nothing of this nice strife:<br>

"In manus tuas! &lt;27&gt; Lord, to thee I call.<br>

Awake, Simon, the fiend is on me fall;<br>

Mine heart is broken; help; I am but dead:<br>

There li'th one on my womb and on mine head.<br>

Help, Simkin, for these false clerks do fight"<br>

This John start up as fast as e'er he might,<br>

And groped by the walles to and fro<br>

To find a staff; and she start up also,<br>

And knew the estres* better than this John,                   *apartment<br>

And saw a little shimmering of a light,<br>

And smote the miller on the pilled* skull;                         *bald<br>

These clerkes beat him well, and let him lie,<br>

And greithen* them, and take their horse anon,        *make ready, dress<br>

That fairer coulde cast a pair of dice<br>

Than Perkin could; and thereto *he was free    *he spent money liberally<br>

Of his dispence, in place of privity.*       where he would not be seen*<br>

Unto a compere* of his owen sort,                               *comrade<br>

That loved dice, and riot, and disport;<br>

And had a wife, that held *for countenance*            *for appearances*<br>

A shop, and swived* for her sustenance.             *prostituted herself<br>

<p id="id00513">4. The Cook's Tale is unfinished in all the manuscripts; but in
some, of minor authority, the Cook is made to break off his
tale, because "it is so foul," and to tell the story of Gamelyn, on
which Shakespeare's "As You Like It" is founded. The story is
not Chaucer's, and is different in metre, and inferior in
composition to the Tales. It is supposed that Chaucer expunged
the Cook's Tale for the same reason that made him on his death-
bed lament that he had written so much "ribaldry."</p>

Of April, that is messenger to May;<br>

There may he see the large woundes wide<br>

Of Lucrece, and of Babylon Thisbe;<br>

The sword of Dido for the false Enee;<br>

The tree of Phillis for her Demophon;<br>

The plaint of Diane, and of Hermion,<br>

Of Ariadne, and Hypsipile;<br>

The barren isle standing in the sea;<br>

The drown'd Leander for his fair Hero;<br>

The teares of Helene, and eke the woe<br>

Or else of Tyrius Apollonius,<br>

How that the cursed king Antiochus<br>

Bereft his daughter of her maidenhead;<br>

That is so horrible a tale to read,<br>

When he her threw upon the pavement.<br>

And therefore he, *of full avisement*,         *deliberately, advisedly*<br>

Would never write in none of his sermons<br>

Of such unkind* abominations;                                 *unnatural<br>

<p id="id00519" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to The Man of Law's Tale</p>

<p id="id00520" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Plight: pulled; the word is an obsolete past tense from
"pluck."</p>

<p id="id00521">2. No more than will Malkin's maidenhead: a proverbial saying;
which, however, had obtained fresh point from the Reeve's
Tale, to which the host doubtless refers.</p>

<p id="id00522">3. De par dieux jeo asente: "by God, I agree".  It is
characteristic that the somewhat pompous Sergeant of Law
should couch his assent in the semi-barbarous French, then
familiar in law procedure.</p>

<p id="id00523">4. Ceyx and Alcyon: Chaucer treats of these in the introduction
to the poem called "The Book of the Duchess."  It relates to the
death of Blanche, wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the
poet's patron, and afterwards his connexion by marriage.</p>

<p id="id00524">5. The Saintes Legend of Cupid: Now called "The Legend of
Good Women". The names of eight ladies mentioned here are
not in the "Legend" as it has come down to us; while those of
two ladies in the "legend" — Cleopatra and Philomela — are her
omitted.</p>

<p id="id00525">6. Not the Muses, who had their surname from the place near
Mount Olympus where the Thracians first worshipped them; but
the nine daughters of Pierus, king of Macedonia, whom he
called the nine Muses, and who, being conquered in a contest
with the genuine sisterhood, were changed into birds.</p>

<p id="id00526">7. Metamorphoseos:  Ovid's.</p>

<p id="id00527">8. Hawebake: hawbuck, country lout; the common proverbial
phrase, "to put a rogue above a gentleman," may throw light on
the reading here, which is difficult.</p>

<p id="id00528" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE. &lt;1&gt;</p>

<p id="id00529" style="margin-top: 2em">O scatheful harm, condition of poverty,<br>

With thirst, with cold, with hunger so confounded;<br>

That very need unwrappeth all thy wound hid.<br>

Maugre thine head thou must for indigence<br>

Or steal, or beg, or borrow thy dispence*.                      *expense<br>

And sayst, thou hast too little, and he hath all:<br>

"Parfay (sayst thou) sometime he reckon shall,<br>

Better to die than to have indigence.<br>

*Thy selve* neighebour will thee despise,                    *that same*<br>

If thou be poor, farewell thy reverence.<br>

I were right now of tales desolate*,                     *barren, empty.<br>

But that a merchant, gone in many a year,<br>

Me taught a tale, which ye shall after hear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00534">In Syria whilom dwelt a company<br>

Of chapmen rich, and thereto sad* and true,            *grave, steadfast<br>

Clothes of gold, and satins rich of hue.<br>

That widewhere* sent their spicery,                    *to distant parts<br>

Their chaffare* was so thriftly** and so new,      *wares **advantageous<br>

That every wight had dainty* to chaffare**              *pleasure **deal<br>

With them, and eke to selle them their ware.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00535">Now fell it, that the masters of that sort<br>

Have *shapen them* to Rome for to wend,           *determined, prepared*<br>

Were it for chapmanhood* or for disport,                        *trading<br>

None other message would they thither send,<br>

But come themselves to Rome, this is the end:<br>

And in such place as thought them a vantage<br>

For their intent, they took their herbergage.*                  *lodging<br>
</p>

<p id="id00536">Sojourned have these merchants in that town<br>

A certain time as fell to their pleasance:<br>

And so befell, that th' excellent renown<br>

Of th' emperore's daughter, Dame Constance,<br>

Reported was, with every circumstance,<br>

Unto these Syrian merchants in such wise,<br>

From day to day, as I shall you devise*                          *relate<br>
</p>

<p id="id00537">This was the common voice of every man<br>

"Our emperor of Rome, God him see*,                 *look on with favour<br>

A daughter hath, that since the the world began,<br>

To reckon as well her goodness and beauty,<br>

Was never such another as is she:<br>

I pray to God in honour her sustene*,                           *sustain<br>

But now to purpose* let us turn again.                     *our tale &lt;3&gt;<br>

And saide; *"What amounteth all this fare?"*             *what means all<br>

Constance answered; "Sir, it is Christ's might,               this ado?*<br>

That helpeth folk out of the fiendes snare:"<br>

And *so farforth* she gan our law declare,            *with such effect*<br>

That she the Constable, ere that it were eve,<br>

Converted, and on Christ made him believe.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00597">This Constable was not lord of the place<br>

Of which I speak, there as he Constance fand,*                    *found<br>

But kept it strongly many a winter space,<br>

Under Alla, king of Northumberland,<br>

That was full wise, and worthy of his hand<br>

Against the Scotes, as men may well hear;<br>

But turn I will again to my mattere.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00598">Satan, that ever us waiteth to beguile,<br>

Saw of Constance all her perfectioun,<br>

And *cast anon how he might quite her while;*    *considered how to have<br>

And made a young knight, that dwelt in that town,        revenge on her*<br>

Love her so hot of foul affectioun,<br>

That verily him thought that he should spill*                    *perish<br>

But* he of her might ones have his will.                         *unless<br>
</p>

<p id="id00599">He wooed her, but it availed nought;<br>

She woulde do no sinne by no way:<br>

And for despite, he compassed his thought<br>

To make her a shameful death to dey;*                               *die<br>

He waiteth when the Constable is away,<br>

And privily upon a night he crept<br>

In Hermegilda's chamber while she slept.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00600">Weary, forwaked* in her orisons,                 *having been long awake<br>

Sleepeth Constance, and Hermegild also.<br>

This knight, through Satanas' temptation;<br>

All softetly is to the bed y-go,*                                  *gone<br>

And cut the throat of Hermegild in two,<br>

And laid the bloody knife by Dame Constance,<br>

And went his way, there God give him mischance.<br>

<p id="id00601">Soon after came the Constable home again,<br>

And eke Alla that king was of that land,<br>

For which full oft he wept and wrung his hand;<br>

And ill the bed the bloody knife he fand<br>

By Dame Constance: Alas! what might she say?<br>

For very woe her wit was all away.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00602">To King Alla was told all this mischance<br>

And eke the time, and where, and in what wise<br>

Fall in disease* and in misaventure.                           *distress<br>
</p>

<p id="id00603">For as the lamb toward his death is brought,<br>

So stood this innocent before the king:<br>

This false knight, that had this treason wrought,<br>

*Bore her in hand* that she had done this thing:   *accused her falsely*<br>

But natheless there was great murmuring<br>

Among the people, that say they cannot guess<br>

That she had done so great a wickedness.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00604">For they had seen her ever virtuous,<br>

And loving Hermegild right as her life:<br>

Of this bare witness each one in that house,<br>

Save he that Hermegild slew with his knife:<br>

This gentle king had *caught a great motife*         *been greatly moved<br>

Of this witness, and thought he would inquere           by the evidence*<br>

Deeper into this case, the truth to lear.*                        *learn<br>

<p id="id00605">Alas! Constance, thou has no champion,<br>

But he that starf for our redemption,                              *died<br>

And bound Satan, and yet li'th where he lay,<br>

So be thy stronge champion this day:<br>

For, but Christ upon thee miracle kithe,*                          *show<br>

Withoute guilt thou shalt be slain *as swithe.*            *immediately*<br>

This woman slew, yet will we us advise*                        *consider<br>

Of this marvel aghast was all the press,<br>

As mazed folk they stood every one<br>

For dread of wreake,* save Constance alone.                   *vengeance<br>

To Rome-ward, sailing full royally,<br>

In which Constance sat full piteously:<br>

She was in such array; nor she will say<br>

Of her estate, although that she should dey.*                       *die<br>

<p id="id00654">King Alla, which that had his mother slain,<br>

As to do any king a reverence.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00656">Great cheere* did this noble senator                           *courtesy<br>

To King Alla and he to him also;<br>

Each of them did the other great honor;<br>

And so befell, that in a day or two<br>

This senator did to King Alla go<br>

To feast, and shortly, if I shall not lie,<br>

Constance's son went in his company.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00657">Some men would say,&lt;17&gt; at request of Constance<br>

This senator had led this child to feast:<br>

I may not tellen every circumstance,<br>

Be as be may, there was he at the least:<br>

But sooth is this, that at his mother's hest*                    *behest<br>

Before Alla during *the meates space,*                       *meal time*<br>

The child stood, looking in the kinges face.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00658">This Alla king had of this child great wonder,<br>

And to the senator he said anon,<br>

"Whose is that faire child that standeth yonder?"<br>

"I n'ot,"* quoth he, "by God and by Saint John;                *know not<br>

A mother he hath, but father hath he none,<br>

That I of wot:" and shortly in a stound*                *short time &lt;18&gt;<br>

He told to Alla how this child was found.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00659">"But God wot," quoth this senator also,<br>

"So virtuous a liver in all my life<br>

I never saw, as she, nor heard of mo'<br>

Of worldly woman, maiden, widow or wife:<br>

I dare well say she hadde lever* a knife                         *rather<br>

Throughout her breast, than be a woman wick',*                   *wicked<br>

There is no man could bring her to that prick.*                   *point<br>
</p>

<p id="id00660">Now was this child as like unto Constance<br>

As possible is a creature to be:<br>

This Alla had the face in remembrance<br>

Of Dame Constance, and thereon mused he,<br>

If that the childe's mother *were aught she*              *could be she*<br>

That was his wife; and privily he sight,*                        *sighed<br>

And sped him from the table *that he might.*       *as fast as he could*<br>
</p>

<p id="id00661">"Parfay,"* thought he, "phantom** is in mine head.          *by my faith<br>

I ought to deem, of skilful judgement,                       **a fantasy<br>

That in the salte sea my wife is dead."<br>

And afterward he made his argument,<br>

"What wot I, if that Christ have hither sent<br>

My wife by sea, as well as he her sent<br>

To my country, from thennes that she went?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id00662">And, after noon, home with the senator.<br>

Went Alla, for to see this wondrous chance.<br>

This senator did Alla great honor,<br>

And hastily he sent after Constance:<br>

But truste well, her liste not to dance.<br>

When that she wiste wherefore was that sond,*                   *summons<br>

Unneth* upon her feet she mighte stand.                 *with difficulty<br>
</p>

<p id="id00663">When Alla saw his wife, fair he her gret,*                      *greeted<br>

And wept, that it was ruthe for to see,<br>

For at the firste look he on her set<br>

He knew well verily that it was she:<br>

And she, for sorrow, as dumb stood as a tree:<br>

So was her hearte shut in her distress,<br>

When she remember'd his unkindeness.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00664">Twice she swooned in his owen sight,<br>

He wept and him excused piteously:<br>

"Now God," quoth he, "and all his hallows bright*                *saints<br>

So wisly* on my soule have mercy,                                *surely<br>

That of your harm as guilteless am I,<br>

As is Maurice my son, so like your face,<br>

Else may the fiend me fetch out of this place."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00665">Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain,<br>

Ere that their woeful heartes mighte cease;<br>

Great was the pity for to hear them plain,*                      *lament<br>

Through whiche plaintes gan their woe increase.<br>

I pray you all my labour to release,<br>

I may not tell all their woe till to-morrow,<br>

I am so weary for to speak of sorrow.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00666">But finally, when that the *sooth is wist,*             *truth is known*<br>

That Alla guiltless was of all her woe,<br>

I trow an hundred times have they kiss'd,<br>

And such a bliss is there betwixt them two,<br>

That, save the joy that lasteth evermo',<br>

There is none like, that any creature<br>

Hath seen, or shall see, while the world may dure.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00667">Then prayed she her husband meekely<br>

In the relief of her long piteous pine,*                         *sorrow<br>

That he would pray her father specially,<br>

That of his majesty he would incline<br>

To vouchesafe some day with him to dine:<br>

She pray'd him eke, that he should by no way<br>

Unto her father no word of her say.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00668">Some men would say,&lt;17&gt; how that the child Maurice<br>

Did this message unto the emperor:<br>

But, as I guess, Alla was not so nice,*                         *foolish<br>

To him that is so sovereign of honor<br>

As he that is of Christian folk the flow'r,<br>

He went himself; and so it may well seem.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00669">This emperor hath granted gentilly<br>

To come to dinner, as he him besought:<br>

</p>

<p id="id00670">The morrow came, and Alla gan him dress,*                    *make ready<br>

And eke his wife, the emperor to meet:<br>

And forth they rode in joy and in gladness,<br>

And when she saw her father in the street,<br>

She lighted down and fell before his feet.<br>

"Father," quoth she, "your younge child Constance<br>

Is now full clean out of your remembrance.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00671">"I am your daughter, your Constance," quoth she,<br>

"That whilom ye have sent into Syrie;<br>

<p id="id00679" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Man of Law's Tale</p>

<p id="id00680" style="margin-top: 2em">1. This tale is believed by Tyrwhitt to have been taken, with no
material change, from the "Confessio Amantis" of John Gower,
who was contemporary with Chaucer, though somewhat his
senior.  In the prologue, the references to the stories of Canace,
and of Apollonius Tyrius, seem to be an attack on Gower, who
had given these tales in his book; whence Tyrwhitt concludes
that the friendship between the two poets suffered some
interruption in the latter part of their lives.  Gower was not the
inventor of the story, which he found in old French romances,
and it is not improbable that Chaucer may have gone to the
same source as Gower, though the latter undoubtedly led the
way.
(Transcriber's note: later commentators have identified the
introduction describing the sorrows of poverty, along with the
other moralising interludes in the tale, as translated from "De
Contemptu Mundi" ("On the contempt of the world") by Pope
Innocent.)</p>

<p id="id00681">2. Transcriber' note: This refers to the game of hazard, a dice
game like craps, in which two  ("ambes ace") won,  and eleven
("six-cinque") lost.</p>

<p id="id00682">3. Purpose: discourse, tale: French "propos".</p>

<p id="id00683">4. "Peace" rhymed with "lese" and "chese", the old forms of
"lose" and "choose".</p>

<p id="id00684">5. According to Middle Age writers there were two motions of
the first heaven; one everything always from east to west above
the stars; the other moving the stars against the first motion,
from west to east, on two other poles.</p>

<p id="id00685">6. Atyzar: the meaning of this word is not known; but "occifer",
murderer, has been suggested instead by Urry, on the authority
of a marginal reading on a manuscript.
(Transcriber's note: later commentators explain it as derived
from Arabic "al-ta'thir", influence - used here in an astrological
sense)</p>

<p id="id00686">7. "Thou knittest thee where thou art not receiv'd,
    Where thou wert well, from thennes art thou weiv'd"
i.e.
"Thou joinest thyself where thou art rejected, and art declined
or departed from the place where thou wert well."  The moon
portends the fortunes of Constance.</p>

<p id="id00687">8. Fand: endeavour; from Anglo-Saxon, "fandian," to try</p>

<p id="id00688">9. Feng: take; Anglo-Saxon "fengian", German, "fangen".</p>

<p id="id00689">10. Him and her on which thy limbes faithfully extend: those
who in faith wear the crucifix.</p>

<p id="id00690">11. The four spirits of tempest: the four angels who held the
four winds of the earth and to whom it was given to hurt the
earth and the sea (Rev. vii. 1, 2).</p>

<p id="id00691">12. Thennes would it not in all a tide: thence would it not move
for long, at all.</p>

<p id="id00692">13. A manner Latin corrupt: a kind of bastard Latin.</p>

<p id="id00693">14. Knave child: male child; German "Knabe".</p>

<p id="id00694">15. Heried: honoured, praised; from Anglo-Saxon, "herian."
Compare German, "herrlich," glorious, honourable.</p>

<p id="id00695">16. Beknow:  confess; German, "bekennen."</p>

God bade us for to wax and multiply;<br>

That gentle text can I well understand.<br>

Eke well I wot, he said, that mine husband<br>

Should leave father and mother, and take to me;<br>

Why then should men speak of it villainy?*     *as if it were a disgrace<br>

He said, that precept thereof had he none:<br>

Men may counsel a woman to be one,*                              *a maid<br>

But counseling is no commandement;<br>

He put it in our owen judgement.<br>

For, hadde God commanded maidenhead,<br>

Then had he damned* wedding out of dread;**           *condemned **doubt<br>

I wot well that th' apostle was a maid,<br>

But natheless, although he wrote and said,<br>

He would that every wight were such as he,<br>

All is but counsel to virginity.<br>

And, since to be a wife he gave me leave<br>

Of indulgence, so is it no repreve*                   *scandal, reproach<br>

To wedde me, if that my make* should die,                 *mate, husband<br>

This is all and some, he held virginity<br>

More profit than wedding in frailty:<br>

And yet in bacon* had I never delight:               *i.e. of Dunmow &lt;9&gt;<br>

For, though the Pope had sitten them beside,<br>

<p id="id00709">Now will I speaken of my fourth husband.<br>

My fourthe husband was a revellour;<br>

This is to say, he had a paramour,<br>

And I was young and full of ragerie,*                        *wantonness<br>

Stubborn and strong, and jolly as a pie.*                        *magpie<br>

Then could I dance to a harpe smale,<br>

And sing, y-wis,* as any nightingale,                         *certainly<br>

When I had drunk a draught of sweete wine.<br>

Metellius, the foule churl, the swine,<br>

That with a staff bereft his wife of life<br>

For she drank wine, though I had been his wife,<br>

Never should he have daunted me from drink:<br>

And, after wine, of Venus most I think.<br>

For all so sure as cold engenders hail,<br>

A liquorish mouth must have a liquorish tail.<br>

In woman vinolent* is no defence,**            *full of wine *resistance<br>

This knowe lechours by experience.<br>

But, lord Christ, when that it rememb'reth me<br>

Upon my youth, and on my jollity,<br>

It tickleth me about mine hearte-root;<br>

Unto this day it doth mine hearte boot,*                           *good<br>

That I have had my world as in my time.<br>

But age, alas! that all will envenime,*                *poison, embitter<br>

Hath me bereft my beauty and my pith:*                           *vigour<br>

Let go; farewell; the devil go therewith.<br>

The flour is gon, there is no more to tell,<br>

The bran, as I best may, now must I sell.<br>

But yet to be right merry will I fand.*                             *try<br>

Now forth to tell you of my fourth husband,<br>

I say, I in my heart had great despite,<br>

That he of any other had delight;<br>

But he was quit,* by God and by Saint Joce:&lt;21&gt;     *requited, paid back<br>

I made for him of the same wood a cross;<br>

Not of my body in no foul mannere,<br>

But certainly I made folk such cheer,<br>

That in his owen grease I made him fry<br>

For anger, and for very jealousy.<br>

By God, in earth I was his purgatory,<br>

For which I hope his soul may be in glory.<br>

For, God it wot, he sat full oft and sung,<br>

When that his shoe full bitterly him wrung.*                    *pinched<br>

There was no wight, save God and he, that wist<br>

In many wise how sore I did him twist.&lt;20&gt;<br>

He died when I came from Jerusalem,<br>

And lies in grave under the *roode beam:*                        *cross*<br>

Although his tomb is not so curious<br>

As was the sepulchre of Darius,<br>

Which that Apelles wrought so subtlely.<br>

It is but waste to bury them preciously.<br>

Let him fare well, God give his soule rest,<br>

He is now in his grave and in his chest.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00710">Now of my fifthe husband will I tell:<br>

God let his soul never come into hell.<br>

And yet was he to me the moste shrew;*              *cruel, ill-tempered<br>

That feel I on my ribbes all *by rew,*                         *in a row<br>

And ever shall, until mine ending day.<br>

But in our bed he was so fresh and gay,<br>

And therewithal so well he could me glose,*                     *flatter<br>

When that he woulde have my belle chose,<br>

Though he had beaten me on every bone,<br>

Yet could he win again my love anon.<br>

I trow, I lov'd him better, for that he<br>

Was of his love so dangerous* to me.                 *sparing, difficult<br>

We women have, if that I shall not lie,<br>

In this matter a quainte fantasy.<br>

Whatever thing we may not lightly have,<br>

Thereafter will we cry all day and crave.<br>

Forbid us thing, and that desire we;<br>

Press on us fast, and thenne will we flee.<br>

With danger* utter we all our chaffare;**      *difficulty **merchandise<br>

Great press at market maketh deare ware,<br>

And too great cheap is held at little price;<br>

This knoweth every woman that is wise.<br>

My fifthe husband, God his soule bless,<br>

Which that I took for love and no richess,<br>

He some time was *a clerk of Oxenford,*            *a scholar of Oxford*<br>

And had left school, and went at home to board<br>

With my gossip,* dwelling in oure town:                       *godmother<br>

God have her soul, her name was Alisoun.<br>

She knew my heart, and all my privity,<br>

Bet than our parish priest, so may I the.*                       *thrive<br>

To her betrayed I my counsel all;<br>

For had my husband pissed on a wall,<br>

Or done a thing that should have cost his life,<br>

To her, and to another worthy wife,<br>

And to my niece, which that I loved well,<br>

I would have told his counsel every deal.*                          *jot<br>

And so I did full often, God it wot,<br>

That made his face full often red and hot<br>

For very shame, and blam'd himself, for he<br>

Had told to me so great a privity.*                              *secret<br>

And so befell that ones in a Lent<br>

(So oftentimes I to my gossip went,<br>

For ever yet I loved to be gay,<br>

And for to walk in March, April, and May<br>

From house to house, to heare sundry tales),<br>

That Jenkin clerk, and my gossip, Dame Ales,<br>

And I myself, into the fieldes went.<br>

Mine husband was at London all that Lent;<br>

I had the better leisure for to play,<br>

And for to see, and eke for to be sey*                             *seen<br>

Of lusty folk; what wist I where my grace*                       *favour<br>

Was shapen for to be, or in what place?                       *appointed<br>

Therefore made I my visitations<br>

To vigilies,* and to processions,                     *festival-eves&lt;22&gt;<br>

To preachings eke, and to these pilgrimages,<br>

To plays of miracles, and marriages,<br>

And weared upon me gay scarlet gites.*                            *gowns<br>

These wormes, nor these mothes, nor these mites<br>

On my apparel frett* them never a deal**                     *fed **whit<br>

And know'st thou why? for they were used* well.                    *worn<br>

Now will I telle forth what happen'd me:<br>

I say, that in the fieldes walked we,<br>

Till truely we had such dalliance,<br>

This clerk and I, that of my purveyance*                      *foresight<br>

I spake to him, and told him how that he,<br>

If I were widow, shoulde wedde me.<br>

For certainly, I say for no bobance,*                      *boasting&lt;23&gt;<br>

Yet was I never without purveyance*                           *foresight<br>

Of marriage, nor of other thinges eke:<br>

I hold a mouse's wit not worth a leek,<br>

That hath but one hole for to starte* to,&lt;24&gt;                    *escape<br>

And if that faile, then is all y-do.*                              *done<br>

[*I bare him on hand* he had enchanted me          *falsely assured him*<br>

(My dame taughte me that subtilty);<br>

And eke I said, I mette* of him all night,                      *dreamed<br>

He would have slain me, as I lay upright,<br>

And all my bed was full of very blood;<br>

But yet I hop'd that he should do me good;<br>

For blood betoken'd gold, as me was taught.<br>

And all was false, I dream'd of him right naught,<br>

But as I follow'd aye my dame's lore,<br>

As well of that as of other things more.] &lt;25&gt;<br>

But now, sir, let me see, what shall I sayn?<br>

Aha! by God, I have my tale again.<br>

When that my fourthe husband was on bier,<br>

I wept algate* and made a sorry cheer,**           *always **countenance<br>

As wives must, for it is the usage;<br>

And with my kerchief covered my visage;<br>

But, for I was provided with a make,*                              *mate<br>

I wept but little, that I undertake*                            *promise<br>

To churche was mine husband borne a-morrow<br>

With neighebours that for him made sorrow,<br>

And Jenkin, oure clerk, was one of tho:*                          *those<br>

As help me God, when that I saw him go<br>

After the bier, methought he had a pair<br>

Of legges and of feet so clean and fair,<br>

That all my heart I gave unto his hold.*                        *keeping<br>

He was, I trow, a twenty winter old,<br>

And I was forty, if I shall say sooth,<br>

But yet I had always a colte's tooth.<br>

Gat-toothed* I was, and that became me well,              *see note &lt;26&gt;<br>

I had the print of Sainte Venus' seal.<br>

[As help me God, I was a lusty one,<br>

And fair, and rich, and young, and *well begone:*        *in a good way*<br>

For certes I am all venerian*              *under the influence of Venus<br>

In feeling, and my heart is martian;*       *under the influence of Mars<br>

Venus me gave my lust and liquorishness,<br>

And Mars gave me my sturdy hardiness.] &lt;25&gt;<br>

Mine ascendant was Taure,* and Mars therein:                     *Taurus<br>

Alas, alas, that ever love was sin!<br>

I follow'd aye mine inclination<br>

By virtue of my constellation:<br>

That made me that I coulde not withdraw<br>

My chamber of Venus from a good fellaw.<br>

[Yet have I Marte's mark upon my face,<br>

And also in another privy place.<br>

For God so wisly* be my salvation,                            *certainly<br>

I loved never by discretion,<br>

But ever follow'd mine own appetite,<br>

All* were he short, or long, or black, or white,                *whether<br>

I took no keep,* so that he liked me,                              *heed<br>

How poor he was, neither of what degree.] &lt;25&gt;<br>

What should I say? but that at the month's end<br>

This jolly clerk Jenkin, that was so hend,*                   *courteous<br>

Had wedded me with great solemnity,<br>

And to him gave I all the land and fee<br>

That ever was me given therebefore:<br>

But afterward repented me full sore.<br>

He woulde suffer nothing of my list.*                          *pleasure<br>

By God, he smote me ones with his fist,<br>

For that I rent out of his book a leaf,<br>

That of the stroke mine eare wax'd all deaf.<br>

Stubborn I was, as is a lioness,<br>

And of my tongue a very jangleress,*                             *prater<br>

And walk I would, as I had done beforn,<br>

From house to house, although he had it sworn:*            *had sworn to<br>

For which he oftentimes woulde preach                         prevent it<br>

And me of olde Roman gestes* teach                              *stories<br>

How that Sulpitius Gallus left his wife<br>

And her forsook for term of all his<br>

For nought but open-headed* he her say**              *bare-headed **saw<br>

Looking out at his door upon a day.<br>

Another Roman &lt;27&gt; told he me by name,<br>

That, for his wife was at a summer game<br>

Without his knowing, he forsook her eke.<br>

And then would he upon his Bible seek<br>

That ilke* proverb of Ecclesiast,                                  *same<br>

Where he commandeth, and forbiddeth fast,<br>

Man shall not suffer his wife go roll about.<br>

Then would he say right thus withoute doubt:<br>

"Whoso that buildeth his house all of sallows,*                 *willows<br>

And pricketh his blind horse over the fallows,<br>

And suff'reth his wife to *go seeke hallows,*         *make pilgrimages*<br>

Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows."<br>

But all for nought; I *sette not a haw*              *cared nothing for*<br>

Of his proverbs, nor of his olde saw;<br>

Nor would I not of him corrected be.<br>

I hate them that my vices telle me,<br>

And so do more of us (God wot) than I.<br>

This made him wood* with me all utterly;                        *furious<br>

I woulde not forbear* him in no case.                            *endure<br>

Now will I say you sooth, by Saint Thomas,<br>

Why that I rent out of his book a leaf,<br>

For which he smote me, so that I was deaf.<br>

He had a book, that gladly night and day<br>

For his disport he would it read alway;<br>

He call'd it Valerie,&lt;28&gt; and Theophrast,<br>

And with that book he laugh'd alway full fast.<br>

And eke there was a clerk sometime at Rome,<br>

A cardinal, that highte Saint Jerome,<br>

That made a book against Jovinian,<br>

Which book was there; and eke Tertullian,<br>

Chrysippus, Trotula, and Heloise,<br>

That was an abbess not far from Paris;<br>

And eke the Parables* of Solomon,                              *Proverbs<br>

Ovide's Art, &lt;29&gt; and bourdes* many one;                          *jests<br>

And alle these were bound in one volume.<br>

And every night and day was his custume<br>

(When he had leisure and vacation<br>

From other worldly occupation)<br>

To readen in this book of wicked wives.<br>

He knew of them more legends and more lives<br>

Than be of goodde wives in the Bible.<br>

For, trust me well, it is an impossible<br>

That any clerk will speake good of wives,<br>

(*But if* it be of holy saintes' lives)                          *unless<br>

Nor of none other woman never the mo'.<br>

Who painted the lion, tell it me, who?<br>

By God, if women haddde written stories,<br>

As clerkes have within their oratories,<br>

They would have writ of men more wickedness<br>

Than all the mark of Adam &lt;30&gt; may redress<br>

The children of Mercury and of Venus,&lt;31&gt;<br>

Be in their working full contrarious.<br>

Mercury loveth wisdom and science,<br>

And Venus loveth riot and dispence.*                       *extravagance<br>

And for their diverse disposition,<br>

Each falls in other's exaltation.<br>

As thus, God wot, Mercury is desolate<br>

In Pisces, where Venus is exaltate,<br>

And Venus falls where Mercury is raised. &lt;32&gt;<br>

Therefore no woman by no clerk is praised.<br>

The clerk, when he is old, and may not do<br>

Of Venus' works not worth his olde shoe,<br>

Then sits he down, and writes in his dotage,<br>

That women cannot keep their marriage.<br>

But now to purpose, why I tolde thee<br>

That I was beaten for a book, pardie.<br>

<p id="id00711">Upon a night Jenkin, that was our sire,*                        *goodman<br>

Was all mankind brought into wretchedness,<br>

For which that Jesus Christ himself was slain,<br>

That bought us with his hearte-blood again.<br>

Of her horrible lust and her liking.<br>

He read it with full good devotion.<br>

He told me eke, for what occasion<br>

Amphiorax at Thebes lost his life:<br>

My husband had a legend of his wife<br>

Eryphile, that for an ouche* of gold                      *clasp, collar<br>

Had privily unto the Greekes told,<br>

Where that her husband hid him in a place,<br>

For which he had at Thebes sorry grace.<br>

Of Luna told he me, and of Lucie;<br>

They bothe made their husbands for to die,<br>

That one for love, that other was for hate.<br>

Luna her husband on an ev'ning late<br>

Empoison'd had, for that she was his foe:<br>

Lucia liquorish lov'd her husband so,<br>

That, for he should always upon her think,<br>

She gave him such a manner* love-drink,                         *sort of<br>

That he was dead before it were the morrow:<br>

And thus algates* husbands hadde sorrow.                         *always<br>

Then told he me how one Latumeus<br>

Complained to his fellow Arius<br>

That in his garden growed such a tree,<br>

On which he said how that his wives three<br>

Hanged themselves for heart dispiteous.<br>

"O leve* brother," quoth this Arius,                               *dear<br>

"Give me a plant of thilke* blessed tree,                          *that<br>

And in my garden planted shall it be."<br>

Of later date of wives hath he read,<br>

That some have slain their husbands in their bed,<br>

And let their *lechour dight them* all the night,      *lover ride them*<br>

While that the corpse lay on the floor upright:<br>

And some have driven nails into their brain,<br>

While that they slept, and thus they have them slain:<br>

Some have them given poison in their drink:<br>

He spake more harm than hearte may bethink.<br>

And therewithal he knew of more proverbs,<br>

Than in this world there groweth grass or herbs.<br>

"Better (quoth he) thine habitation<br>

Be with a lion, or a foul dragon,<br>

Than with a woman using for to chide.<br>

Better (quoth he) high in the roof abide,<br>

Than with an angry woman in the house,<br>

They be so wicked and contrarious:<br>

They hate that their husbands loven aye."<br>

He said, "A woman cast her shame away<br>

When she cast off her smock;" and farthermo',<br>

"A fair woman, but* she be chaste also,                          *except<br>

All suddenly three leaves have I plight*                        *plucked<br>

Out of his book, right as he read, and eke<br>

I with my fist so took him on the cheek,<br>

That in our fire he backward fell adown.<br>

And he up start, as doth a wood* lion,                          *furious<br>

And with his fist he smote me on the head,<br>

That on the floor I lay as I were dead.<br>

And when he saw how still that there I lay,<br>

He was aghast, and would have fled away,<br>

Till at the last out of my swoon I braid,*                         *woke<br>

"Oh, hast thou slain me, thou false thief?" I said<br>

<p id="id00714" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Wife of Bath's Tale</p>

<p id="id00715" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Among the evidences that Chaucer's great work was left
incomplete, is the absence of any link of connexion between the
Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale, and what goes before. This
deficiency has in some editions caused the Squire's and the
Merchant's Tales to be interposed between those of the Man of
Law and the Wife of Bath; but in the Merchant's Tale there is
internal proof that it was told after the jolly Dame's.  Several
manuscripts contain verses designed to serve as a connexion;
but they are evidently not Chaucer's, and it is unnecessary to
give them here. Of this Prologue, which may fairly be regarded
as a distinct autobiographical tale, Tyrwhitt says: "The
extraordinary length of it, as well as the vein of pleasantry that
runs through it, is very suitable to the character of the speaker.
The greatest part must have been of Chaucer's own invention,
though one may plainly see that he had been reading the popular
invectives against marriage and women in general; such as the
'Roman de la Rose,'  'Valerius ad Rufinum, De non Ducenda
Uxore,' ('Valerius to Rufinus, on not being ruled by one's wife')
and particularly 'Hieronymus contra Jovinianum.' ('Jerome
against Jovinianus')  St Jerome, among other things designed to
discourage marriage, has inserted in his treatise a long passage
from 'Liber Aureolus Theophrasti de Nuptiis.' ('Theophrastus's
Golden Book of Marriage')."</p>

Assay,* and he shall find it, that so do'th.                        *try<br>

For be we never so vicious within,<br>

We will be held both wise and clean of sin.<br>

And some men said, that great delight have we<br>

For to be held stable and eke secre,*                          *discreet<br>

And in one purpose steadfastly to dwell,<br>

And not bewray* a thing that men us tell.                     *give away<br>

But that tale is not worth a rake-stele.*                   *rake-handle<br>

Pardie, we women canne nothing hele,*                          *hide &lt;9&gt;<br>

Witness on Midas; will ye hear the tale?<br>

Ovid, amonges other thinges smale*                                *small<br>

Saith, Midas had, under his longe hairs,<br>

Growing upon his head two ass's ears;<br>

The whiche vice he hid, as best he might,<br>

Full subtlely from every man's sight,<br>

That, save his wife, there knew of it no mo';<br>

He lov'd her most, and trusted her also;<br>

He prayed her, that to no creature<br>

She woulde tellen of his disfigure.<br>

She swore him, nay, for all the world to win,<br>

She would not do that villainy or sin,<br>

To make her husband have so foul a name:<br>

She would not tell it for her owen shame.<br>

But natheless her thoughte that she died,<br>

That she so longe should a counsel hide;<br>

Her thought it swell'd so sore about her heart<br>

That needes must some word from her astart<br>

And, since she durst not tell it unto man<br>

Down to a marish fast thereby she ran,<br>

Till she came there, her heart was all afire:<br>

And, as a bittern bumbles* in the mire,           *makes a humming noise<br>

She laid her mouth unto the water down<br>

"Bewray me not, thou water, with thy soun'"<br>

Quoth she, "to thee I tell it, and no mo',<br>

Mine husband hath long ass's eares two!<br>

Now is mine heart all whole; now is it out;<br>

I might no longer keep it, out of doubt."<br>

Here may ye see, though we a time abide,<br>

Yet out it must, we can no counsel hide.<br>

The remnant of the tale, if ye will hear,<br>

Read in Ovid, and there ye may it lear.*                          *learn<br>

<p id="id00752">This knight, of whom my tale is specially,<br>

When that he saw he might not come thereby,<br>

That is to say, what women love the most,<br>

Within his breast full sorrowful was his ghost.*                 *spirit<br>

But home he went, for he might not sojourn,<br>

The day was come, that homeward he must turn.<br>

And in his way it happen'd him to ride,<br>

In all his care,* under a forest side,                 *trouble, anxiety<br>

Where as he saw upon a dance go<br>

Of ladies four-and-twenty, and yet mo',<br>

Toward this ilke* dance he drew full yern,**        *same **eagerly &lt;10&gt;<br>

The hope that he some wisdom there should learn;<br>

But certainly, ere he came fully there,<br>

Y-vanish'd was this dance, he knew not where;<br>

No creature saw he that bare life,<br>

Save on the green he sitting saw a wife,<br>

A fouler wight there may no man devise.*                  *imagine, tell<br>

Against* this knight this old wife gan to rise,                 *to meet<br>

And said, "Sir Knight, hereforth* lieth no way.               *from here<br>

Tell me what ye are seeking, by your fay.<br>

Paraventure it may the better be:<br>

These olde folk know muche thing." quoth she.<br>

My leve* mother," quoth this knight, "certain,                     *dear<br>

I am but dead, but if* that I can sayn                           *unless<br>

Could ye me wiss,* I would well *quite your hire."*       *instruct &lt;11&gt;<br>

"Plight me thy troth here in mine hand," quoth she,         *reward you*<br>

"The nexte thing that I require of thee<br>

Thou shalt it do, if it be in thy might,<br>

And I will tell it thee ere it be night."<br>

"Have here my trothe," quoth the knight; "I grant."<br>

"Thenne," quoth she, "I dare me well avaunt,*             *boast, affirm<br>

Thy life is safe, for I will stand thereby,<br>

Upon my life the queen will say as I:<br>

Let see, which is the proudest of them all,<br>

That wears either a kerchief or a caul,<br>

That dare say nay to that I shall you teach.<br>

Let us go forth withoute longer speech<br>

Then *rowned she a pistel* in his ear,          *she whispered a secret*<br>

And bade him to be glad, and have no fear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00753">When they were come unto the court, this knight<br>

Said, he had held his day, as he had hight,*                   *promised<br>

And ready was his answer, as he said.<br>

Full many a noble wife, and many a maid,<br>

And many a widow, for that they be wise, —<br>

The queen herself sitting as a justice, —<br>

Assembled be, his answer for to hear,<br>

And afterward this knight was bid appear.<br>

To every wight commanded was silence,<br>

And that the knight should tell in audience,<br>

What thing that worldly women love the best.<br>

This knight he stood not still, as doth a beast,<br>

But to this question anon answer'd<br>

With manly voice, that all the court it heard,<br>

"My liege lady, generally," quoth he,<br>

"Women desire to have the sovereignty<br>

As well over their husband as their love<br>

And for to be in mast'ry him above.<br>

This is your most desire, though ye me kill,<br>

Do as you list, I am here at your will."<br>

In all the court there was no wife nor maid<br>

Nor widow, that contraried what he said,<br>

But said, he worthy was to have his life.<br>

And with that word up start that olde wife<br>

Which that the knight saw sitting on the green.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00754">"Mercy," quoth she, "my sovereign lady queen,<br>

Ere that your court departe, do me right.<br>

I taughte this answer unto this knight,<br>

For which he plighted me his trothe there,<br>

The firste thing I would of him requere,<br>

He would it do, if it lay in his might.<br>

Before this court then pray I thee, Sir Knight,"<br>

Quoth she, "that thou me take unto thy wife,<br>

For well thou know'st that I have kept* thy life.             *preserved<br>

If I say false, say nay, upon thy fay."*                          *faith<br>

This knight answer'd, "Alas, and well-away!<br>

I know right well that such was my behest.*                     *promise<br>

For Godde's love choose a new request<br>

Take all my good, and let my body go."<br>

"Nay, then," quoth she, "I shrew* us bothe two,                   *curse<br>

For though that I be old, and foul, and poor,<br>

I n'ould* for all the metal nor the ore,                      *would not<br>

That under earth is grave,* or lies above                        *buried<br>

But if thy wife I were and eke thy love."<br>

"My love?" quoth he, "nay, my damnation,<br>

Alas! that any of my nation<br>

Should ever so foul disparaged be.<br>

But all for nought; the end is this, that he<br>

Constrained was, that needs he muste wed,<br>

And take this olde wife, and go to bed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00755">Now woulde some men say paraventure<br>

That for my negligence I do no cure*                      *take no pains<br>

To tell you all the joy and all th' array<br>

That at the feast was made that ilke* day.                         *same<br>

To which thing shortly answeren I shall:<br>

I say there was no joy nor feast at all,<br>

There was but heaviness and muche sorrow:<br>

For privily he wed her on the morrow;<br>

And all day after hid him as an owl,<br>

So woe was him, his wife look'd so foul<br>

Great was the woe the knight had in his thought<br>

When he was with his wife to bed y-brought;<br>

He wallow'd, and he turned to and fro.<br>

This olde wife lay smiling evermo',<br>

And said, "Dear husband, benedicite,<br>

Fares every knight thus with his wife as ye?<br>

Is this the law of king Arthoures house?<br>

Is every knight of his thus dangerous?*           *fastidious, niggardly<br>

I am your owen love, and eke your wife<br>

I am she, which that saved hath your life<br>

And certes yet did I you ne'er unright.<br>

Why fare ye thus with me this firste night?<br>

Ye fare like a man had lost his wit.<br>

What is my guilt? for God's love tell me it,<br>

And it shall be amended, if I may."<br>

"Amended!" quoth this knight; "alas, nay, nay,<br>

It will not be amended, never mo';<br>

Thou art so loathly, and so old also,<br>

And thereto* comest of so low a kind,                       *in addition<br>

That little wonder though I  wallow and wind;*       *writhe, turn about<br>

So woulde God, mine hearte woulde brest!"*                        *burst<br>

"Is this," quoth she, "the cause of your unrest?"<br>

"Yea, certainly," quoth he; "no wonder is."<br>

"Now, Sir," quoth she, "I could amend all this,<br>

If that me list, ere it were dayes three,<br>

*So well ye mighte bear you unto me.*              *if you could conduct<br>

But, for ye speaken of such gentleness                     yourself well<br>

As is descended out of old richess,                          towards me*<br>

That therefore shalle ye be gentlemen;<br>

Such arrogancy is *not worth a hen.*                      *worth nothing<br>

Look who that is most virtuous alway,<br>

*Prive and apert,* and most intendeth aye        *in private and public*<br>

To do the gentle deedes that he can;<br>

And take him for the greatest gentleman.<br>

Christ will,* we claim of him our gentleness,           *wills, requires<br>

Not of our elders* for their old richess.                     *ancestors<br>

For though they gave us all their heritage,<br>

For which we claim to be of high parage,*                *birth, descent<br>

Yet may they not bequeathe, for no thing,<br>

To none of us, their virtuous living<br>

That made them gentlemen called to be,<br>

And bade us follow them in such degree.<br>

Well can the wise poet of Florence,<br>

That highte Dante, speak of this sentence:*                   *sentiment<br>

Lo, in such manner* rhyme is Dante's tale.                      *kind of<br>

'Full seld'* upriseth by his branches smale                      *seldom<br>

Prowess of man, for God of his goodness<br>

Wills that we claim of him our gentleness;' &lt;12&gt;<br>

For of our elders may we nothing claim<br>

But temp'ral things that man may hurt and maim.<br>

Eke every wight knows this as well as I,<br>

If gentleness were planted naturally<br>

Unto a certain lineage down the line,<br>

Prive and apert, then would they never fine*                      *cease<br>

To do of gentleness the fair office<br>

Then might they do no villainy nor vice.<br>

Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house<br>

Betwixt this and the mount of Caucasus,<br>

And let men shut the doores, and go thenne,*                     *thence<br>

Yet will the fire as fair and lighte brenne*                       *burn<br>

As twenty thousand men might it behold;<br>

*Its office natural aye will it hold,*              *it will perform its<br>

On peril of my life, till that it die.                     natural duty*<br>

Here may ye see well how that gentery*              *gentility, nobility<br>

Is not annexed to possession,<br>

Since folk do not their operation<br>

Alway, as doth the fire, lo, *in its kind*        *from its very nature*<br>

For, God it wot, men may full often find<br>

A lorde's son do shame and villainy.<br>

And he that will have price* of his gent'ry,             *esteem, honour<br>

For* he was boren of a gentle house,                            *because<br>

And had his elders noble and virtuous,<br>

And will himselfe do no gentle deedes,<br>

Nor follow his gentle ancestry, that dead is,<br>

He is not gentle, be he duke or earl;<br>

For villain sinful deedes make a churl.<br>

For gentleness is but the renomee*                               *renown<br>

Of thine ancestors, for their high bounte,*             *goodness, worth<br>

Which is a strange thing to thy person:<br>

Thy gentleness cometh from God alone.<br>

Then comes our very* gentleness of grace;                          *true<br>

It was no thing bequeath'd us with our place.<br>

Think how noble, as saith Valerius,<br>

Was thilke* Tullius Hostilius,                                     *that<br>

That out of povert' rose to high<br>

Read in Senec, and read eke in Boece,<br>

There shall ye see express, that it no drede* is,                 *doubt<br>

That he is gentle that doth gentle deedes.<br>

And therefore, leve* husband, I conclude,                          *dear<br>

Albeit that mine ancestors were rude,<br>

Yet may the highe God, — and so hope I, —<br>

Grant me His grace to live virtuously:<br>

Then am I gentle when that I begin<br>

To live virtuously, and waive* sin.                             *forsake<br>

<p id="id00756">"And whereas ye of povert' me repreve,*                        *reproach<br>

And certes, every man, maiden, or wife<br>

May understand that Jesus, heaven's king,<br>

Ne would not choose a virtuous living.<br>

*Glad povert'* is an honest thing, certain;          *poverty cheerfully<br>

He that coveteth is a poore wight<br>

For he would have what is not in his might<br>

But he that nought hath, nor coveteth to have,<br>

Is rich, although ye hold him but a knave.*        *slave, abject wretch<br>

*Very povert' is sinne,* properly.        *the only true poverty is sin*<br>

Juvenal saith of povert' merrily:<br>

Before the thieves he may sing and play &lt;13&gt;<br>

Povert' is hateful good,&lt;14&gt; and, as I guess,<br>

A full great *bringer out of business;*           *deliver from trouble*<br>

A great amender eke of sapience<br>

To him that taketh it in patience.<br>

Povert' is this, although it seem elenge*                  *strange &lt;15&gt;<br>

Possession that no wight will challenge<br>

Povert' full often, when a man is low,<br>

Makes him his God and eke himself to know<br>

Povert' a spectacle* is, as thinketh me            *a pair of spectacles<br>

Through which he may his very* friendes see.                       *true<br>

<p id="id00759" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Wife of Bath's Tale</p>

<p id="id00760" style="margin-top: 2em">1. It is not clear whence Chaucer derived this tale. Tyrwhitt
thinks it was taken from the story of Florent, in the first book of
Gower's "Confessio Amantis;" or perhaps from an older
narrative from which Gower himself borrowed. Chaucer has
condensed and otherwise improved the fable, especially by
laying the scene, not in Sicily, but at the court of our own King
Arthur.</p>

<p id="id00761">2. Limitours: begging friars. See note 18 to the prologue to the
Tales.</p>

<p id="id00762">3. Thorpes: villages.  Compare German, "Dorf,"; Dutch,
"Dorp."</p>

<p id="id00763">4. Undermeles: evening-tides, afternoons; "undern" signifies the
evening; and "mele," corresponds to the German "Mal" or
"Mahl," time.</p>

<p id="id00777" style="margin-top: 2em">This worthy limitour, this noble Frere,<br>

He made always a manner louring cheer*                      *countenance<br>

Upon the Sompnour; but for honesty*                            *courtesy<br>

No villain word as yet to him spake he:<br>

But at the last he said unto the Wife:<br>

"Dame," quoth he, "God give you right good life,<br>

Ye have here touched, all so may I the,*                         *thrive<br>

In school matter a greate difficulty.<br>

Ye have said muche thing right well, I say;<br>

But, Dame, here as we ride by the way,<br>

Us needeth not but for to speak of game,<br>

And leave authorities, in Godde's name,<br>

To preaching, and to school eke of clergy.<br>

But if it like unto this company,<br>

I will you of a Sompnour tell a game;<br>

Pardie, ye may well knowe by the name,<br>

That of a Sompnour may no good be said;<br>

I pray that none of you be *evil paid;*                   *dissatisfied*<br>

A Sompnour is a runner up and down<br>

With mandements* for fornicatioun,                 *mandates, summonses*<br>

And is y-beat at every towne's end."<br>

Then spake our Host; "Ah, sir, ye should be hend*         *civil, gentle<br>

And courteous, as a man of your estate;<br>

In company we will have no debate:<br>

Tell us your tale, and let the Sompnour be."<br>

"Nay," quoth the Sompnour, "let him say by me<br>

What so him list; when it comes to my lot,<br>

By God, I shall him quiten* every groat!                    *pay him off<br>

I shall him telle what a great honour<br>

It is to be a flattering limitour<br>

And his office I shall him tell y-wis".<br>

Our Host answered, "Peace, no more of this."<br>

And afterward he said unto the frere,<br>

"Tell forth your tale, mine owen master dear."<br>

<p id="id00778" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Friar's tale</p>

<p id="id00779" style="margin-top: 2em">1. On the Tale of the Friar, and that of the Sompnour which
follows, Tyrwhitt has remarked that they "are well engrafted
upon that of the Wife of Bath. The ill-humour which shows
itself between these two characters is quite natural, as no two
professions at that time were at more constant variance.  The
regular clergy, and particularly the mendicant friars, affected a
total exemption from all ecclesiastical jurisdiction,  except that
of the Pope, which made them exceedingly obnoxious to the
bishops and of course to all the inferior officers of the national
hierarchy." Both tales, whatever their origin, are bitter satires
on the greed and worldliness of the Romish clergy.</p>

<h3 id="id00780" style="margin-top: 3em">THE TALE.</h3>

<p id="id00781" style="margin-top: 2em">Whilom* there was dwelling in my country                 *once on a time<br>

An archdeacon, a man of high degree,<br>

That boldely did execution,<br>

In punishing of fornication,<br>

Of witchecraft, and eke of bawdery,<br>

Of defamation, and adultery,<br>

Of churche-reeves,* and of testaments,                    *churchwardens<br>

Of contracts, and of lack of sacraments,<br>

And eke of many another manner* crime,                          *sort of<br>

Which needeth not rehearsen at this time,<br>

Of usury, and simony also;<br>

But, certes, lechours did he greatest woe;<br>

They shoulde singen, if that they were hent;*                    *caught<br>

And smale tithers&lt;1&gt; were foul y-shent,*         *troubled, put to shame<br>

If any person would on them complain;<br>

There might astert them no pecunial pain.&lt;2&gt;<br>

For smalle tithes, and small offering,<br>

He made the people piteously to sing;<br>

For ere the bishop caught them with his crook,<br>

They weren in the archedeacon's book;<br>

Then had he, through his jurisdiction,<br>

Power to do on them correction.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00782">He had a Sompnour ready to his hand,<br>

A slier boy was none in Engleland;<br>

For subtlely he had his espiaille,*                           *espionage<br>

That taught him well where it might aught avail.<br>

He coulde spare of lechours one or two,<br>

To teache him to four and twenty mo'.<br>

For, — though this Sompnour wood* be as a hare, —        *furious, mad<br>

To tell his harlotry I will not spare,<br>

For we be out of their correction,<br>

They have of us no jurisdiction,<br>

Ne never shall have, term of all their lives.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00783">"Peter; so be the women of the stives,"*                          *stews<br>

Quoth this Sompnour, "y-put out of our cure."*                     *care<br>
</p>

<p id="id00784">"Peace, with mischance and with misaventure,"<br>

Our Hoste said, "and let him tell his tale.<br>

Now telle forth, and let the Sompnour gale,*              *whistle; bawl<br>

Nor spare not, mine owen master dear."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00785">This false thief, the Sompnour (quoth the Frere),<br>

Had always bawdes ready to his hand,<br>

As any hawk to lure in Engleland,<br>

That told him all the secrets that they knew, —<br>

For their acquaintance was not come of new;<br>

They were his approvers* privily.                             *informers<br>

He took himself at great profit thereby:<br>

His master knew not always what he wan.*                            *won<br>

Withoute mandement, a lewed* man                               *ignorant<br>

He could summon, on pain of Christe's curse,<br>

And they were inly glad to fill his purse,<br>

And make him greate feastes at the nale.*                      *alehouse<br>

And right as Judas hadde purses smale,*                           *small<br>

And was a thief, right such a thief was he,<br>

His master had but half *his duety.*                *what was owing him*<br>

He was (if I shall give him his laud)<br>

A thief, and eke a Sompnour, and a bawd.<br>

And he had wenches at his retinue,<br>

That whether that Sir Robert or Sir Hugh,<br>

Or Jack, or Ralph, or whoso that it were<br>

That lay by them, they told it in his ear.<br>

Thus were the wench and he of one assent;<br>

And he would fetch a feigned mandement,<br>

And to the chapter summon them both two,<br>

And pill* the man, and let the wenche go.                *plunder, pluck<br>

Then would he say, "Friend, I shall for thy sake<br>

Do strike thee out of oure letters blake;*                        *black<br>

Thee thar* no more as in this case travail;                        *need<br>

I am thy friend where I may thee avail."<br>

Certain he knew of bribers many mo'<br>

Than possible is to tell in yeare's two:<br>

For in this world is no dog for the bow,&lt;3&gt;<br>

That can a hurt deer from a whole know,<br>

Bet* than this Sompnour knew a sly lechour,                      *better<br>

Or an adult'rer, or a paramour:<br>

And, for that was the fruit of all his rent,<br>

Therefore on it he set all his intent.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00786">And so befell, that once upon a day.<br>

This Sompnour, waiting ever on his prey,<br>

Rode forth to summon a widow, an old ribibe,&lt;4&gt;<br>

Feigning a cause, for he would have a bribe.<br>

And happen'd that he saw before him ride<br>

A gay yeoman under a forest side:<br>

A bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen,<br>

He had upon a courtepy* of green,                         *short doublet<br>

A hat upon his head with fringes blake.*                          *black<br>

"Sir," quoth this Sompnour, "hail, and well o'ertake."<br>

"Welcome," quoth he, "and every good fellaw;<br>

Whither ridest thou under this green shaw?"*                       shade<br>

Saide this yeoman; "wilt thou far to-day?"<br>

This Sompnour answer'd him, and saide, "Nay.<br>

Here faste by," quoth he, "is mine intent<br>

To ride, for to raisen up a rent,<br>

That longeth to my lorde's duety."<br>

"Ah! art thou then a bailiff?" "Yea," quoth he.<br>

He durste not for very filth and shame<br>

Say that he was a Sompnour, for the name.<br>

"De par dieux," &lt;5&gt; quoth this yeoman, "leve* brother,             *dear<br>

Thou art a bailiff, and I am another.<br>

I am unknowen, as in this country.<br>

Of thine acquaintance I will praye thee,<br>

And eke of brotherhood, if that thee list.*                      *please<br>

I have gold and silver lying in my chest;<br>

If that thee hap to come into our shire,<br>

All shall be thine, right as thou wilt desire."<br>

"Grand mercy,"* quoth this Sompnour, "by my faith."        *great thanks<br>

Each in the other's hand his trothe lay'th,<br>

For to be sworne brethren till they dey.*                        *die&lt;6&gt;<br>

As full of venom be those wariangles,*               * butcher-birds &lt;7&gt;<br>

Another day if that I should you seech?"*                   *seek, visit<br>

This yeoman him answered in soft speech;<br>

Ere we depart I shall thee so well wiss,*                        *inform<br>

That of mine house shalt thou never miss."<br>

Now, brother," quoth this Sompnour, "I you pray,<br>

Teach me, while that we ride by the way,<br>

(Since that ye be a bailiff as am I,)<br>

Some subtilty, and tell me faithfully<br>

For mine office how that I most may win.<br>

And *spare not* for conscience or for sin,             *conceal nothing*<br>

Now by my trothe, brother mine," said he,<br>

As I shall tell to thee a faithful tale:<br>

My wages be full strait and eke full smale;<br>

My lord is hard to me and dangerous,*                         *niggardly<br>

And therefore by extortion I live,<br>

Forsooth I take all that men will me give.<br>

Algate* by sleighte, or by violence,                            *whether<br>

From year to year I win all my dispence;<br>

I can no better tell thee faithfully."<br>

This yeoman gan a little for to smile.<br>

In sundry shapes and not always in one?"<br>

"For we," quoth he, "will us in such form make.<br>

As most is able our prey for to take."<br>

"What maketh you to have all this labour?"<br>

"Full many a cause, leve Sir Sompnour,"<br>

Saide this fiend. "But all thing hath a time;<br>

The day is short and it is passed prime,<br>

With deade bodies, in full sundry wise,<br>

Till it be so that thou forsake me."<br>

"Nay," quoth this Sompnour, "that shall ne'er betide.<br>

I am a yeoman, that is known full wide;<br>

My trothe will I hold, as in this case;<br>

For though thou wert the devil Satanas,<br>

My trothe will I hold to thee, my brother,<br>

And if that any of us have more than other,<br>

Let him be true, and part it with his brother."<br>

"I grante," quoth the devil, "by my fay."<br>

And with that word they rode forth their way,<br>

The Sompnour said, "Here shall we have a prey,"<br>

And near the fiend he drew, *as nought ne were,*          *as if nothing<br>

Full privily, and rowned* in his ear:                   were the matter*<br>

"Hearken, my brother, hearken, by thy faith,                  *whispered<br>

Or elles stint* a while and thou shalt see."                       *stop<br>

The carter thwack'd his horses on the croup,<br>

And they began to drawen and to stoop.<br>

"Heit now," quoth he; "there, Jesus Christ you bless,<br>

And all his handiwork, both more and less!<br>

Upon her knees, he said in this mannere;<br>

"The devil," quoth she, "so fetch him ere he dey,*                  *die<br>

<p id="id00794" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Small tithers:  people who did not pay their full tithes.  Mr
Wright remarks that "the sermons of the friars in the fourteenth
century were most frequently designed to impress the ahsolute
duty of paying full tithes and offerings".</p>

<p id="id00795">2. There might astert them no pecunial pain: they got off with
no mere pecuniary punishment. (Transcriber's note: "Astert"
means "escape".  An alternative reading of this line is "there
might astert him no pecunial pain" i.e. no fine ever escaped him
(the archdeacon))</p>

<p id="id00796">3. A dog for the bow:  a dog attending a huntsman with bow
and arrow.</p>

<p id="id00797">4. Ribibe: the name of a musical instrument; applied to an old
woman because of the shrillness of her voice.</p>

<p id="id00798">5. De par dieux: by the gods.</p>

<p id="id00799">6. See note 12 to the Knight's Tale.</p>

<p id="id00800">7. Wariangles: butcher-birds; which are very noisy and
ravenous, and tear in pieces the birds on which they prey; the
thorn on which they do this was said to become poisonous.</p>

<p id="id00801">8. Medieval legends located hell in the North.</p>

<p id="id00802">9. The Pythoness: the witch, or woman, possesed with a
prophesying spirit; from the Greek, "Pythia."  Chaucer of
course refers to the raising of Samuel's spirit by the witch of
Endor.</p>

<p id="id00803">10. Dante and Virgil were both poets who had in fancy visited
Hell.</p>

<p id="id00804">11. Tholed: suffered, endured; "thole" is still used in Scotland in
the same sense.</p>

<p id="id00806">13. Liart: grey; elsewhere applied by Chaucer to the hairs of an
old man. So Burns, in the "Cotter's Saturday Night," speaks of
the gray temples of "the sire" — "His lyart haffets wearing thin

<h4 id="id00811" style="margin-top: 2em">THE PROLOGUE.</h4>

<p id="id00812" style="margin-top: 2em">The Sompnour in his stirrups high he stood,<br>

Upon this Friar his hearte was so wood,*                        *furious<br>

That like an aspen leaf he quoke* for ire:             *quaked, trembled<br>

"Lordings," quoth he, "but one thing I desire;<br>

I you beseech, that of your courtesy,<br>

Since ye have heard this false Friar lie,<br>

As suffer me I may my tale tell<br>

This Friar boasteth that he knoweth hell,<br>

And, God it wot, that is but little wonder,<br>

Friars and fiends be but little asunder.<br>

For, pardie, ye have often time heard tell,<br>

How that a friar ravish'd was to hell<br>

In spirit ones by a visioun,<br>

And, as an angel led him up and down,<br>

To shew him all the paines that there were,<br>

In all the place saw he not a frere;<br>

Of other folk he saw enough in woe.<br>

Unto the angel spake the friar tho;*                               *then<br>

'Now, Sir,' quoth he, 'have friars such a grace,<br>

That none of them shall come into this place?'<br>

'Yes' quoth the angel; 'many a millioun:'<br>

And unto Satanas he led him down.<br>

'And now hath Satanas,' said he, 'a tail<br>

Broader than of a carrack&lt;1&gt; is the sail.<br>

Hold up thy tail, thou Satanas,' quoth he,<br>

'Shew forth thine erse, and let the friar see<br>

Where is the nest of friars in this place.'<br>

And *less than half a furlong way of space*            *immediately* &lt;2&gt;<br>

Right so as bees swarmen out of a hive,<br>

Out of the devil's erse there gan to drive<br>

A twenty thousand friars *on a rout.*                       *in a crowd*<br>

And throughout hell they swarmed all about,<br>

And came again, as fast as they may gon,<br>

And in his erse they creeped every one:<br>

He clapt his tail again, and lay full still.<br>

This friar, when he looked had his fill<br>

Upon the torments of that sorry place,<br>

His spirit God restored of his grace<br>

Into his body again, and he awoke;<br>

But natheless for feare yet he quoke,<br>

So was the devil's erse aye in his mind;<br>

That is his heritage, *of very kind*                *by his very nature*<br>

God save you alle, save this cursed Frere;<br>

<h4 id="id00816" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE.</h4>

<p id="id00817" style="margin-top: 2em">Lordings, there is in Yorkshire, as I guess,<br>

A marshy country called Holderness,<br>

In which there went a limitour about<br>

To preach, and eke to beg, it is no doubt.<br>

And so befell that on a day this frere<br>

Had preached at a church in his mannere,<br>

And specially, above every thing,<br>

Excited he the people in his preaching<br>

To trentals, &lt;1&gt; and to give, for Godde's sake,<br>

Wherewith men mighte holy houses make,<br>

There as divine service is honour'd,<br>

Not there as it is wasted and devour'd,<br>

Nor where it needeth not for to be given,<br>

As to possessioners, &lt;2&gt; that may liven,<br>

Thanked be God, in wealth and abundance.<br>

"Trentals," said he, "deliver from penance<br>

Their friendes' soules, as well old as young,<br>

Yea, when that they be hastily y-sung, —<br>

Not for to hold a priest jolly and gay,<br>

He singeth not but one mass in a day.<br>

"Deliver out," quoth he, "anon the souls.<br>

Full hard it is, with flesh-hook or with owls*                     *awls<br>

To be y-clawed, or to burn or bake: &lt;3&gt;<br>

Now speed you hastily, for Christe's sake."<br>

And when this friar had said all his intent,<br>

With qui cum patre&lt;4&gt; forth his way he went,<br>

When folk in church had giv'n him what them lest;*              *pleased<br>

He went his way, no longer would he rest,<br>

With scrip and tipped staff, *y-tucked high:*      *with his robe tucked<br>

In every house he gan to pore* and pry,                   up high* *peer<br>

And begged meal and cheese, or elles corn.<br>

His fellow had a staff tipped with horn,<br>

A pair of tables* all of ivory,                         *writing tablets<br>

And a pointel* y-polish'd fetisly,**                  *pencil **daintily<br>

And wrote alway the names, as he stood;<br>

Of all the folk that gave them any good,<br>

Askaunce* that he woulde for them pray.                    *see note &lt;5&gt;<br>

"Give us a bushel wheat, or malt, or rey,*                          *rye<br>

Or elles what you list, we may not chese;*                       *choose<br>

A Godde's halfpenny, &lt;6&gt; or a mass penny;<br>

Or give us of your brawn, if ye have any;<br>

A dagon* of your blanket, leve dame,                            *remnant<br>

Our sister dear, — lo, here I write your name,—<br>

Bacon or beef, or such thing as ye find."<br>

A sturdy harlot* went them aye behind,                   *manservant &lt;7&gt;<br>

That was their hoste's man, and bare a sack,<br>

And what men gave them, laid it on his back<br>

And when that he was out at door, anon<br>

He *planed away* the names every one,                       *rubbed out*<br>

That he before had written in his tables:<br>

He served them with nifles* and with fables. —             *silly tales<br>
</p>

<p id="id00818">"Nay, there thou liest, thou Sompnour," quoth the Frere.<br>

"Peace," quoth our Host, "for Christe's mother dear;<br>

Tell forth thy tale, and spare it not at all."<br>

"So thrive I," quoth this Sompnour, "so I shall." —<br>
</p>

<p id="id00819">So long he went from house to house, till he<br>

Came to a house, where he was wont to be<br>

Refreshed more than in a hundred places<br>

Sick lay the husband man, whose that the place is,<br>

Bed-rid upon a couche low he lay:<br>

*"Deus hic,"* quoth he; "O Thomas friend, good day,"       *God be here*<br>

Said this friar, all courteously and soft.<br>

"Thomas," quoth he, "God *yield it you,* full oft       *reward you for*<br>

Have I upon this bench fared full well,<br>

Here have I eaten many a merry meal."<br>

And from the bench he drove away the cat,<br>

And laid adown his potent* and his hat,                       *staff &lt;8&gt;<br>

And eke his scrip, and sat himself adown:<br>

His fellow was y-walked into town<br>

Forth with his knave,* into that hostelry                       *servant<br>

I saw you not this fortenight and more."<br>

"God wot," quoth he, "labour'd have I full sore;<br>

And specially for thy salvation<br>

Have I said many a precious orison,<br>

And for mine other friendes, God them bless.<br>

I have this day been at your church at mess,*                      *mass<br>

And said sermon after my simple wit,<br>

Not all after the text of Holy Writ;<br>

For it is hard to you, as I suppose,<br>

And therefore will I teach you aye the glose.*           *gloss, comment<br>

Glosing is a full glorious thing certain,<br>

For letter slayeth, as we clerkes* sayn.                       *scholars<br>

There have I taught them to be charitable,<br>

And spend their good where it is reasonable.<br>

And there I saw our dame; where is she?"<br>

"Yonder I trow that in the yard she be,"<br>

Saide this man; "and she will come anon."<br>

"Hey master, welcome be ye by Saint John,"<br>

Saide this wife; "how fare ye heartily?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id00821">This friar riseth up full courteously,<br>

And her embraceth *in his armes narrow,*                        *closely<br>

And kiss'th her sweet, and chirketh as a sparrow<br>

With his lippes: "Dame," quoth he, "right well,<br>

Yet saw I not this day so fair a wife<br>

In all the churche, God so save me,"<br>

"Yea, God amend defaultes, Sir," quoth she;<br>

"Algates* welcome be ye, by my fay."                             *always<br>

"Chide him right well, for sainte charity.<br>

Ire is a thing that high God hath defended,*                  *forbidden<br>

And thereof will I speak a word or two."<br>

"Now, master," quoth the wife, "ere that I go,<br>

What will ye dine? I will go thereabout."<br>

"Now, Dame," quoth he, "je vous dis sans doute, &lt;9&gt;<br>

Had I not of a capon but the liver,<br>

And of your white bread not but a shiver,*                   *thin slice<br>

"Now, Sir," quoth she, "but one word ere I go;<br>

And borel folk in riches and dispence<br>

Of meat and drink, and in their foul delight.<br>

We have this worlde's lust* all in despight**      * pleasure **contempt<br>

Lazar and Dives lived diversely,<br>

And diverse guerdon* hadde they thereby.                         *reward<br>

Whoso will pray, he must fast and be clean,<br>

And fat his soul, and keep his body lean<br>

We fare as saith th' apostle; cloth* and food                  *clothing<br>

Suffice us, although they be not full good.<br>

The cleanness and the fasting of us freres<br>

Maketh that Christ accepteth our prayeres.<br>

Lo, Moses forty days and forty night<br>

Fasted, ere that the high God full of might<br>

Spake with him in the mountain of Sinai:<br>

With empty womb* of fasting many a day                          *stomach<br>

Received he the lawe, that was writ<br>

With Godde's finger; and Eli,&lt;14&gt; well ye wit,*                    *know<br>

In Mount Horeb, ere he had any speech<br>

With highe God, that is our live's leech,*            *physician, healer<br>

He fasted long, and was in contemplance.<br>

Aaron, that had the temple in governance,<br>

And eke the other priestes every one,<br>

Into the temple when they shoulde gon<br>

To praye for the people, and do service,<br>

They woulde drinken in no manner wise<br>

No drinke, which that might them drunken make,<br>

But there in abstinence pray and wake,<br>

Lest that they died: take heed what I say —<br>

But* they be sober that for the people pray —                   *unless<br>

Ware that, I say — no more: for it sufficeth.<br>

Our Lord Jesus, as Holy Writ deviseth,*                        *narrates<br>

Gave us example of fasting and prayeres:<br>

Therefore we mendicants, we sely* freres,                 *simple, lowly<br>

Be wedded to povert' and continence,<br>

To charity, humbless, and abstinence,<br>

To persecution for righteousness,<br>

To weeping, misericorde,* and to cleanness.                  *compassion<br>

And therefore may ye see that our prayeres<br>

(I speak of us, we mendicants, we freres),<br>

Be to the highe God more acceptable<br>

Than youres, with your feastes at your table.<br>

From Paradise first, if I shall not lie,<br>

Was man out chased for his gluttony,<br>

And chaste was man in Paradise certain.<br>

But hark now, Thomas, what I shall thee sayn;<br>

I have no text of it, as I suppose,<br>

But I shall find it in *a manner glose;*             *a kind of comment*<br>

That specially our sweet Lord Jesus<br>

Spake this of friars, when he saide thus,<br>

'Blessed be they that poor in spirit be'<br>

And so forth all the gospel may ye see,<br>

Whether it be liker our profession,<br>

Or theirs that swimmen in possession;<br>

Fy on their pomp, and on their gluttony,<br>

And on their lewedness!  I them defy.<br>

Me thinketh they be like Jovinian,&lt;15&gt;<br>

Fat as a whale, and walking as a swan;<br>

All vinolent* as bottle in the spence;**      *full of wine **store-room<br>

Their prayer is of full great reverence;<br>

When they for soules say the Psalm of David,<br>

Lo, 'Buf' they say, Cor meum eructavit.&lt;16&gt;<br>

Who follow Christe's gospel and his lore*                      *doctrine<br>

But we, that humble be, and chaste, and pore,*                     *poor<br>

Workers of Godde's word, not auditours?*                        *hearers<br>

Therefore right as a hawk *upon a sours*                        *rising*<br>

Up springs into the air, right so prayeres<br>

Of charitable and chaste busy freres<br>

*Make their sours* to Godde's eares two.                          *rise*<br>

And by that lord that called is Saint Ive,<br>

*N'ere thou our brother, shouldest thou not thrive;*    *see note  &lt;17&gt;*<br>

In our chapiter pray we day and night<br>

To Christ, that he thee sende health and might,<br>

<p id="id00831" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Sompnour's Tale</p>

<p id="id00832" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Trentals: The money given to the priests for performing thirty
masses for the dead, either in succession or on the anniversaries
of their death; also the masses themselves, which were very
profitable to the clergy.</p>

<p id="id00833">2. Possessioners: The regular religious orders, who had lands
and fixed revenues; while the friars, by their vows, had to
depend on voluntary contributions, though their need suggested
many modes of evading the prescription.</p>

<p id="id00834">3. In Chaucer's day the most material notions about the tortures
of hell prevailed, and were made the most of by the clergy, who
preyed on the affection and fear of the survivors, through the
ingenious doctrine of purgatory. Old paintings and illuminations
represent the dead as torn by hooks, roasted in fires, boiled in
pots, and subjected to many other physical torments.</p>

<p id="id00835">4. Qui cum patre: "Who with the father"; the closing words of
the final benediction pronounced at Mass.</p>

<p id="id00836">5. Askaunce: The word now means sideways or asquint; here it
means "as if;" and its force is probably to suggest that the
second friar, with an ostentatious stealthiness, noted down the
names of the liberal, to make them believe that they would be
remembered in the holy beggars' orisons.</p>

<p id="id00837">6. A Godde's kichel/halfpenny: a little cake/halfpenny, given for
God's sake.</p>

<p id="id00838">7. Harlot: hired servant; from Anglo-Saxon, "hyran," to hire;
the word was commonly applied to males.</p>

<p id="id00839">8. Potent: staff; French, "potence," crutch, gibbet.</p>

<p id="id00840">9. Je vous dis sans doute: French; "I tell you without doubt."</p>

<p id="id00841">10. Dortour: dormitory; French, "dortoir."</p>

<p id="id00842">12. The Rules of St Benedict granted peculiar honours and
immunities to monks who had lived fifty years — the jubilee
period — in the order. The usual reading of the words ending
the two lines is "loan" or "lone," and "alone;" but to walk alone
does not seem to have been any peculiar privilege of a friar,
while the idea of precedence, or higher place at table and in
processions, is suggested by the reading in the text.</p>

<p id="id00843">13. Borel folk:  laymen, people who are not learned; "borel"
was a kind of coarse cloth.</p>

<p id="id00844">14. Eli: Elijah (1 Kings, xix.)</p>

<p id="id00845">15. An emperor Jovinian was famous in the mediaeval  legends
for his pride and luxury</p>

<p id="id00846">16. Cor meum eructavit: literally, "My heart has belched forth;"
in our translation, (i.e. the Authorised "King James" Version -
Transcriber) "My heart is inditing a goodly matter."  (Ps. xlv.
1.). "Buf" is meant to represent the sound  of an eructation, and
to show the "great reverence" with which "those in possession,"
the monks of the rich monasteries, performed divine service,</p>

<p id="id00847">17. N'ere thou our brother, shouldest thou not thrive: if thou
wert not of our  brotherhood, thou shouldst have no hope of
recovery.</p>

<p id="id00848">18. Thomas' life of Ind: The life of  Thomas of India - i.e. St.
Thomas the Apostle, who was said to have travelled to India.</p>

<p id="id00849">19. Potestate:  chief magistrate or judge; Latin, "potestas;"
Italian, "podesta."  Seneca relates the story of Cornelius Piso;
"De Ira," i. 16.</p>

<p id="id00850">20. Placebo: An anthem of the Roman Church, from Psalm
cxvi. 9, which in the Vulgate reads, "Placebo Domino in regione
vivorum" — "I will please the Lord in the land of the living"</p>

<p id="id00851">21. The Gysen:  Seneca calls it the Gyndes; Sir John Mandeville
tells the story of the Euphrates. "Gihon," was the name of one
of the four rivers of Eden (Gen. ii, 13).</p>

<p id="id00852">22. Him that harrowed Hell: Christ. See note 14 to the Reeve's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id00853">23. Mr. Wright says that "it was a common practice to grant
under the conventual seal to benefactors and others a brotherly
participation in the spiritual good works of the convent, and in
their expected reward after death."</p>

<p id="id00854">24. The friar had received a master's degree.</p>

<p id="id00855">25. The regular number of monks or friars in a convent was
fixed at twelve,  with a superior, in imitation of the apostles and
their Master; and large religious houses were held to consist of
so many convents.</p>

<p id="id00908">"Then will I," quoth the marquis softely,<br>

"That in thy chamber I, and thou, and she,<br>

<p id="id00910">No wonder is though that she be astoned,*                    *astonished<br>

To see so great a guest come in that place,<br>

She never was to no such guestes woned;*               *accustomed, wont<br>

For which she looked with full pale face.<br>

But shortly forth this matter for to chase,*            *push on, pursue<br>

These are the wordes that the marquis said<br>

To this benigne, very,* faithful maid.                         *true &lt;6&gt;<br>

<p id="id00911">"Griseld'," he said, "ye shall well understand,<br>

It liketh to your father and to me<br>

That I you wed, and eke it may so stand,<br>

As I suppose ye will that it so be:<br>

But these demandes ask I first," quoth he,<br>

"Since that it shall be done in hasty wise;<br>

Will ye assent, or elles you advise?*                          *consider<br>

And never ye to grudge,* night nor day,                          *murmur<br>

And eke when I say Yea, ye say not Nay,<br>

Neither by word, nor frowning countenance?<br>

Swear this, and here I swear our alliance."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00913">Wond'ring upon this word, quaking for dread,<br>

She saide; "Lord, indigne and unworthy<br>

Am I to this honour that ye me bede,*                             *offer<br>

But as ye will yourself, right so will I:<br>

And here I swear, that never willingly<br>

In word or thought I will you disobey,<br>

For to be dead; though me were loth to dey."*                       *die<br>

<p id="id00914">"This is enough, Griselda mine," quoth he.<br>

And forth he went with a full sober cheer,<br>

Out at the door, and after then came she,<br>

And to the people he said in this mannere:<br>

"This is my wife," quoth he, "that standeth here.<br>

Honoure her, and love her, I you pray,<br>

Whoso me loves; there is no more to say."<br>
</p>

<p id="id00915">And, for that nothing of her olde gear<br>

She shoulde bring into his house, he bade<br>

That women should despoile* her right there;                      *strip<br>

Of which these ladies were nothing glad<br>

To handle her clothes wherein she was clad:<br>

Full rudely, and with their fingers small<br>

A crown upon her head they have dress'd,<br>

And set her full of nouches &lt;7&gt; great and small:<br>

Of her array why should I make a tale?<br>

Unneth* the people her knew for her fairness,                  *scarcely<br>

When she transmuted was in such richess.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00917">The marquis hath her spoused with a ring<br>

Brought for the same cause, and then her set<br>

In revel, till the sunne gan descend.<br>

<p id="id00918">And, shortly forth this tale for to chase,<br>

I say, that to this newe marchioness<br>

God hath such favour sent her of his grace,<br>

That it ne seemed not by likeliness<br>

That she was born and fed in rudeness, —<br>

As in a cot, or in an ox's stall, —<br>

But nourish'd in an emperore's hall.<br>

*Unnethes trowed* they, but durst have sworn,        *scarcely believed*<br>

Neither in word, in cheer, nor countenance<br>

(For, as it seemed, she was not aggriev'd);<br>

She saide; "Lord, all lies in your pleasance,<br>

My child and I, with hearty obeisance<br>

Be youres all, and ye may save or spill*                        *destroy<br>

<p id="id00935">Glad was the marquis for her answering,<br>

But yet he feigned as he were not so;<br>

All dreary was his cheer and his looking<br>

When that he should out of the chamber go.<br>

Soon after this, a furlong way or two,&lt;8&gt;<br>

He privily hath told all his intent<br>

Unto a man, and to his wife him sent.<br>

<p id="id00936">A *manner sergeant* was this private* man,              *kind of squire*<br>

The which he faithful often founden had                        *discreet<br>

In thinges great, and eke such folk well can<br>

Do execution in thinges bad:<br>

The lord knew well, that he him loved and drad.*                *dreaded<br>

And when this sergeant knew his lorde's will,<br>

Into the chamber stalked he full still.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00937">"Madam," he said, "ye must forgive it me,<br>

Though I do thing to which I am constrain'd;<br>

Ye be so wise, that right well knowe ye<br>

*That lordes' hestes may not be y-feign'd;*               *see note &lt;9&gt;*<br>

They may well be bewailed and complain'd,<br>

But men must needs unto their lust* obey;                      *pleasure<br>

And so will I, there is no more to say.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00938">"This child I am commanded for to take."<br>

And spake no more, but out the child he hent*                    *seized<br>

Dispiteously,* and gan a cheer** to make     *unpityingly **show, aspect<br>

As though he would have slain it ere he went.<br>

Griseldis must all suffer and consent:<br>

And as a lamb she sat there meek and still,<br>

And let this cruel sergeant do his will<br>
</p>

<p id="id00939">Suspicious* was the diffame** of this man,    *ominous **evil reputation<br>

Suspect his face, suspect his word also,<br>

Suspect the time in which he this began:<br>

Alas! her daughter, that she loved so,<br>

She weened* he would have it slain right tho,**          *thought **then<br>

But natheless she neither wept nor siked,*                       *sighed<br>

Conforming her to what the marquis liked.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00940">But at the last to speake she began,<br>

And meekly she unto the sergeant pray'd,<br>

So as he was a worthy gentle man,<br>

That she might kiss her child, ere that it died:<br>

And in her barme* this little child she laid,                *lap, bosom<br>

With full sad face, and gan the child to bless,*                  *cross<br>

And lulled it, and after gan it kiss.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00941">And thus she said in her benigne voice:<br>

Farewell, my child, I shall thee never see;<br>

But since I have thee marked with the cross,<br>

Of that father y-blessed may'st thou be<br>

That for us died upon a cross of tree:<br>

Thy soul, my little child, I *him betake,*             *commit unto him*<br>

For this night shalt thou dien for my sake.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00942">I trow* that to a norice** in this case                 *believe **nurse<br>

It had been hard this ruthe* for to see:                  *pitiful sight<br>

Well might a mother then have cried, "Alas!"<br>

But natheless so sad steadfast was she,<br>

That she endured all adversity,<br>

And to the sergeant meekely she said,<br>

"Have here again your little younge maid.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00943">"Go now," quoth she, "and do my lord's behest.<br>

And one thing would I pray you of your grace,<br>

*But if* my lord forbade you at the least,                      *unless*<br>

Bury this little body in some place,<br>

That neither beasts nor birdes it arace."*                    *tear &lt;10&gt;<br>

But he no word would to that purpose say,<br>

But took the child and went upon his way.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00944">The sergeant came unto his lord again,<br>

And of Griselda's words and of her cheer*                     *demeanour<br>

He told him point for point, in short and plain,<br>

And him presented with his daughter dear.<br>

Somewhat this lord had ruth in his mannere,<br>

But natheless his purpose held he still,<br>

As lordes do, when they will have their will;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00945">And bade this sergeant that he privily<br>

Shoulde the child full softly wind and wrap,<br>

With alle circumstances tenderly,<br>

And carry it in a coffer, or in lap;<br>

But, upon pain his head off for to swap,*                        *strike<br>

That no man shoulde know of his intent,<br>

Nor whence he came, nor whither that he went;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00946">But at Bologna, to his sister dear,<br>

That at that time of Panic'* was Countess,                       *Panico<br>

He should it take, and shew her this mattere,<br>

Beseeching her to do her business<br>

This child to foster in all gentleness,<br>

And whose child it was he bade her hide<br>

From every wight, for aught that might betide.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00947">The sergeant went, and hath fulfill'd this thing.<br>

But to the marquis now returne we;<br>

For now went he full fast imagining<br>

If by his wife's cheer he mighte see,<br>

Or by her wordes apperceive, that she<br>

Were changed; but he never could her find,<br>

But ever-in-one* alike sad** and kind.           *constantly **steadfast<br>
</p>

<p id="id00948">As glad, as humble, as busy in service,<br>

Was she to him, in every *manner wise;*                    *sort of way*<br>

And of her daughter not a word spake she;<br>

*No accident for no adversity*            *no change of humour resulting<br>

My people *sickly bear* our marriage;          *regard with displeasure*<br>

And namely* since my son y-boren is,                         *especially<br>

<p id="id00954">"I woulde live in peace, if that I might;<br>

To be a murd'rer is a hateful name.<br>

<p id="id01038" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Clerk's Tale</p>

<p id="id01039" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Petrarch, in his Latin romance, "De obedientia et fide uxoria
Mythologia," (Of obedient and faithful wives in Mythology)
translated the charming story of "the patient Grizel" from the
Italian of Bocaccio's "Decameron;" and Chaucer has closely
followed Petrarch's translation, made in 1373, the year before
that in which he died.  The fact that the embassy to Genoa, on
which Chaucer was sent, took place in 1372-73, has lent
countenance to the opinion that the English poet did actually
visit the Italian bard at Padua, and hear the story from his own
lips.  This, however, is only a probability; for it is a moot point
whether the two poets ever met.</p>

<p id="id01040">2. Vesulus:  Monte Viso, a lofty peak at the junction of the
Maritime and Cottian Alps; from two springs on its east side
rises the Po.</p>

<p id="id01041">3. Buxomly: obediently; Anglo-Saxon, "bogsom," old English,
"boughsome," that can be easily bent or bowed; German,
"biegsam," pliant, obedient.</p>

<p id="id01042">4. Well ofter of the well than of the tun she drank: she drank
water much more often than wine.</p>

<p id="id01043">5. Undern: afternoon, evening, though by some "undern"
is understood as dinner-time — 9 a. m. See note 4 to the Wife of
Bath's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01044">6. Very: true; French "vrai".</p>

<p id="id01045">7. Nouches: Ornaments of some kind not precisely known;
some editions read "ouches," studs, brooches. (Transcriber's
note: The OED gives "nouches" as a form of "ouches,"
buckles)</p>

<p id="id01046">8. A furlong way or two: a short time; literally, as long as it
takes to walk one or two furlongs (a furlong is 220 yards)</p>

<p id="id01047">9. Lordes' hestes may not be y-feign'd: it will not do merely to
feign compliance with a lord's commands.</p>

<p id="id01048">10. Arace: tear; French, "arracher."</p>

<p id="id01049">11. Fele: many; German, "viel."</p>

<p id="id01050">12. Dear enough a jane: worth nothing.  A jane was a small coin
of little worth, so the meaning is "not worth a red cent".</p>

<p id="id01051">13. Mo: me.  "This is one of the most licentious corruptions of
orthography," says Tyrwhitt, "that I remember to have observed
in Chaucer;" but such liberties were common among the
European poets of his time,  when there was an extreme lack of
certainty in orthography.</p>

<p id="id01052">14. The fourteen lines that follow are translated almost literally
from Petrarch's Latin.</p>

<p id="id01053">15. For great skill is he proved that he wrought: for it is most
reasonable that He should prove or test that which he made.</p>

<p id="id01054">16. Chichevache, in old popular fable, was a monster that fed
only on good women, and was always very thin from scarcity of
such food; a corresponding monster, Bycorne, fed only on
obedient and kind husbands, and was always fat. The origin of
the fable was French; but Lydgate has a ballad on the subject.
"Chichevache" literally means "niggardly" or "greedy cow."</p>

<p id="id01055">17. Countertail: Counter-tally or counter-foil; something exactly
corresponding.</p>

<p id="id01056">18. Aventail: forepart of a helmet, vizor.</p>

<p id="id01061" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Merchant's Tale</p>

<p id="id01062" style="margin-top: 2em">1.  Though the manner in which the Merchant takes up the
closing words of the Envoy to the Clerk's Tale, and refers to
the patience of Griselda, seems to prove beyond doubt that
the order of the Tales in the text is the right one, yet in
some manuscripts of good authority the Franklin's Tale
follows the Clerk's, and the Envoy is concluded by this
stanza: —
"This worthy Clerk when ended was his tale,
Our Hoste said, and swore by cocke's bones
'Me lever were than a barrel of ale
My wife at home had heard this legend once;
This is a gentle tale for the nonce;
As, to my purpose, wiste ye my will.
But thing that will not be, let it be still.'"</p>

<p id="id01063">In other manuscripts of less authority the Host proceeds, in
two similar stanzas, to impose a Tale on the Franklin; but
Tyrwhitt is probably right in setting them aside as spurious,
and in admitting the genuineness of the first only, if it be
supposed that Chaucer forgot to cancel it when he had
decided on another mode of connecting the Merchant's with
the Clerk's Tale.</p>

And follow'd aye his bodily delight<br>

On women, where as was his appetite,<br>

As do these fooles that be seculeres.&lt;2&gt;<br>

And, when that he was passed sixty years,<br>

Were it for holiness, or for dotage,<br>

I cannot say, but such a great corage*                      *inclination<br>

With face sad,* his tale he hath them told:              *grave, earnest<br>

He saide, "Friendes, I am hoar and old,<br>

And almost (God wot) on my pitte's* brink,                      *grave's<br>

Upon my soule somewhat must I think.<br>

I have my body foolishly dispended,<br>

Blessed be God that it shall be amended;<br>

For I will be certain a wedded man,<br>

And that anon in all the haste I can,<br>

Unto some maiden, fair and tender of age;<br>

I pray you shape* for my marriage                    * arrange, contrive<br>

All suddenly, for I will not abide:<br>

And I will fond* to espy, on my side,                               *try<br>

To whom I may be wedded hastily.<br>

But forasmuch as ye be more than,<br>

Ye shalle rather* such a thing espy<br>

Than I, and where me best were to ally.<br>

But one thing warn I you, my friendes dear,<br>

I will none old wife have in no mannere:<br>

She shall not passe sixteen year certain.<br>

Old fish and younge flesh would I have fain.<br>

Better," quoth he, "a pike than a pickerel,*                 *young pike<br>

And better than old beef is tender veal.<br>

I will no woman thirty year of age,<br>

It is but beanestraw and great forage.<br>

And eke these olde widows (God it wot)<br>

They conne* so much craft on Wade's boat,&lt;5&gt;                       *know<br>

*So muche brooke harm when that them lest,*         *they can do so much<br>

That with them should I never live in rest.         harm when they wish*<br>

For sundry schooles make subtle clerkes;<br>

Woman of many schooles half a clerk is.<br>

But certainly a young thing men may guy,*                         *guide<br>

Right as men may warm wax with handes ply.*                  *bend,mould<br>

Wherefore I say you plainly in a clause,<br>

I will none old wife have, right for this cause.<br>

For if so were I hadde such mischance,<br>

That I in her could have no pleasance,<br>

Then should I lead my life in avoutrie,*                       *adultery<br>

And go straight to the devil when I die.<br>

Nor children should I none upon her getten:<br>

Yet *were me lever* houndes had me eaten                *I would rather*<br>

Than that mine heritage shoulde fall<br>

In strange hands: and this I tell you all.<br>

I doubte not I know the cause why<br>

Men shoulde wed: and farthermore know I<br>

There speaketh many a man of marriage<br>

That knows no more of it than doth my page,<br>

For what causes a man should take a wife.<br>

If he ne may not live chaste his life,<br>

Take him a wife with great devotion,<br>

Because of lawful procreation<br>

Of children, to th' honour of God above,<br>

And not only for paramour or love;<br>

And for they shoulde lechery eschew,<br>

And yield their debte when that it is due:<br>

Or for that each of them should help the other<br>

In mischief,* as a sister shall the brother,                    *trouble<br>

And live in chastity full holily.<br>

But, Sires, by your leave, that am not I,<br>

For, God be thanked, I dare make avaunt,*                         *boast<br>

I feel my limbes stark* and suffisant                            *strong<br>

To do all that a man belongeth to:<br>

I wot myselfe best what I may do.<br>

Though I be hoar, I fare as doth a tree,<br>

That blossoms ere the fruit y-waxen* be;                          *grown<br>

The blossomy tree is neither dry nor dead;<br>

I feel me now here hoar but on my head.<br>

Mine heart and all my limbes are as green<br>

As laurel through the year is for to seen.*                         *see<br>

Almost he swelt* and swooned where he stood,                    *fainted<br>

So sore had Venus hurt him with her brand,<br>

As that she bare it dancing in her hand.<br>

And to his bed he went him hastily;<br>

No more of him as at this time speak I;<br>

But there I let him weep enough and plain,*                      *bewail<br>

Till freshe May will rue upon his pain.<br>

O perilous fire, that in the bedstraw breedeth!<br>

O foe familiar,* that his service bedeth!**     *domestic &lt;11&gt; **offers<br>

O servant traitor, O  false homely hewe,*                  *servant &lt;12&gt;<br>

Like to the adder in bosom shy untrue,<br>

God shield us alle from your acquaintance!<br>

O January, drunken in pleasance<br>

Of marriage, see how thy Damian,<br>

Thine owen squier and thy boren* man,                         *born &lt;13&gt;<br>

Intendeth for to do thee villainy:*                  *dishonour, outrage<br>

God grante thee thine *homehy foe* t' espy.     *enemy in the household*<br>

For in this world is no worse pestilence<br>

Than homely foe, all day in thy presence.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01081">Performed hath the sun his arc diurn,*                            *daily<br>

No longer may the body of him sojourn<br>

On the horizon, in that latitude:<br>

Night with his mantle, that is dark and rude,<br>

Gan overspread the hemisphere about:<br>

For which departed is this *lusty rout*               *pleasant company*<br>

From January, with thank on every side.<br>

Home to their houses lustily they ride,<br>

Where as they do their thinges as them lest,<br>

And when they see their time they go to rest.<br>

Soon after that this hasty* January                               *eager<br>

Will go to bed, he will no longer tarry.<br>

He dranke hippocras, clarre, and vernage &lt;14&gt;<br>

Of spices hot, to increase his courage;<br>

And many a lectuary* had he full fine,                           *potion<br>

Such as the cursed monk Dan Constantine&lt;15&gt;<br>

Hath written in his book *de Coitu;*             *of sexual intercourse*<br>

To eat them all he would nothing eschew:<br>

And to his privy friendes thus said he:<br>

"For Godde's love, as soon as it may be,<br>

Let *voiden all* this house in courteous wise."         *everyone leave*<br>

And they have done right as he will devise.<br>

Men drinken, and the travers* draw anon;                       *curtains<br>

The bride is brought to bed as still as stone;<br>

And when the bed was with the priest y-bless'd,<br>

Out of the chamber every wight him dress'd,<br>

And January hath fast in arms y-take<br>

His freshe May, his paradise, his make.*                           *mate<br>

He lulled her, he kissed her full oft;<br>

With thicke bristles of his beard unsoft,<br>

Like to the skin of houndfish,* sharp as brere**        *dogfish **briar<br>

(For he was shav'n all new in his mannere),<br>

He rubbed her upon her tender face,<br>

And saide thus; "Alas! I must trespace<br>

To you, my spouse, and you greatly offend,<br>

Ere time come that I will down descend.<br>

But natheless consider this," quoth he,<br>

"There is no workman, whatsoe'er he be,<br>

That may both worke well and hastily:<br>

This will be done at leisure perfectly.<br>

It is *no force* how longe that we play;                     *no matter*<br>

In true wedlock coupled be we tway;<br>

And blessed be the yoke that we be in,<br>

For in our actes may there be no sin.<br>

A man may do no sinne with his wife,<br>

Nor hurt himselfe with his owen knife;<br>

For we have leave to play us by the law."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01082">Thus labour'd he, till that the day gan daw,<br>

And then he took a sop in fine clarre,<br>

And upright in his bedde then sat he.<br>

And after that he sang full loud and clear,<br>

And kiss'd his wife, and made wanton cheer.<br>

He was all coltish, full of ragerie *                        *wantonness<br>

And full of jargon as a flecked pie.&lt;16&gt;<br>

The slacke skin about his necke shaked,<br>

While that he sang, so chanted he and craked.*                 *quavered<br>

But God wot what that May thought in her heart,<br>

When she him saw up sitting in his shirt<br>

In his night-cap, and with his necke lean:<br>

She praised not his playing worth a bean.<br>

Then said he thus; "My reste will I take<br>

Now day is come, I may no longer wake;<br>

And down he laid his head and slept till prime.<br>

And afterward, when that he saw his time,<br>

Up rose January, but freshe May<br>

Helde her chamber till the fourthe day,<br>

As usage is of wives for the best.<br>

For every labour some time must have rest,<br>

Or elles longe may he not endure;<br>

This is to say, no life of creature,<br>

Be it of fish, or bird, or beast, or man.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01083">Now will I speak of woeful Damian,<br>

That languisheth for love, as ye shall hear;<br>

Therefore I speak to him in this manneare.<br>

I say. "O silly Damian, alas!<br>

Answer to this demand, as in this case,<br>

How shalt thou to thy lady, freshe May,<br>

Telle thy woe? She will alway say nay;<br>

Eke if thou speak, she will thy woe bewray; *                    *betray<br>

God be thine help, I can no better say.<br>

This sicke Damian in Venus' fire<br>

So burned that he died for desire;<br>

For which he put his life *in aventure,*                       *at risk*<br>

No longer might he in this wise endure;<br>

But privily a penner* gan he borrow,                       *writing-case<br>

And in a letter wrote he all his sorrow,<br>

In manner of a complaint or a lay,<br>

Unto his faire freshe lady May.<br>

And in a purse of silk, hung on his shirt,<br>

He hath it put, and laid it at his heart.<br>

So long had Maius in her chamber abided,<br>

As custom is unto these nobles all.<br>

A bride shall not eaten in the ball<br>

Till dayes four, or three days at the least,<br>

Y-passed be; then let her go to feast.<br>

The fourthe day complete from noon to noon,<br>

When that the highe masse was y-done,<br>

In halle sat this January, and May,<br>

As fresh as is the brighte summer's day.<br>

And so befell, how that this goode man<br>

Remember'd him upon this Damian.<br>

And saide; "Saint Mary, how may this be,<br>

That Damian attendeth not to me?<br>

Is he aye sick? or how may this betide?"<br>

His squiers, which that stoode there beside,<br>

Excused him, because of his sickness,<br>

Which letted* him to do his business:                          *hindered<br>

None other cause mighte make him tarry.<br>

"That me forthinketh,"* quoth this January              *grieves, causes<br>

"He is a gentle squier, by my truth;                          uneasiness<br>

He is as wise, as discreet, and secre',*                 *secret, trusty<br>

As any man I know of his degree,<br>

And thereto manly and eke serviceble,<br>

And for to be a thrifty man right able.<br>

But after meat, as soon as ever I may<br>

I will myself visit him, and eke May,<br>

To do him all the comfort that I can."<br>

And for that word him blessed every man,<br>

That of his bounty and his gentleness<br>

He woulde so comforten in sickness<br>

His squier, for it was a gentle deed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01085">"Dame," quoth this January, "take good heed,<br>

At after meat, ye with your women all<br>

Do him disport, he is a gentle man;<br>

And telle him that I will him visite,<br>

*Have I nothing but rested me a lite:*          *when only I have rested<br>

And speed you faste, for I will abide                       me a little*<br>

Till that ye sleepe faste by my side."<br>

And with that word he gan unto him call<br>

A squier, that was marshal of his hall,<br>

And told him certain thinges that he wo'ld.<br>

This freshe May hath straight her way y-hold,<br>

With all her women, unto Damian.<br>

Down by his beddes side sat she than,*                             *then<br>

Comforting him as goodly as she may.<br>

This Damian, when that his time he say,*                            *saw<br>

In secret wise his purse, and eke his bill,<br>

In which that he y-written had his will,<br>

Hath put into her hand withoute more,<br>

Save that he sighed wondrous deep and sore,<br>

And softely to her right thus said he:<br>

"Mercy, and that ye not discover me:<br>

For I am dead if that this thing be kid."*              *discovered &lt;18&gt;<br>

The purse hath she in her bosom hid,<br>

And went her way; ye get no more of me;<br>

But unto January come is she,<br>

That on his bedde's side sat full soft.<br>

He took her, and he kissed her full oft,<br>

And laid him down to sleep, and that anon.<br>

She feigned her as that she muste gon<br>

There as ye know that every wight must need;<br>

And when she of this bill had taken heed,<br>

She rent it all to cloutes* at the last,                      *fragments<br>

And in the privy softely it cast.<br>

Who studieth* now but faire freshe May?                   *is thoughtful<br>

Adown by olde January she lay,<br>

That slepte, till the cough had him awaked:<br>

Anon he pray'd her strippe her all naked,<br>

He would of her, he said, have some pleasance;<br>

And said her clothes did him incumbrance.<br>

And she obey'd him, be her *lefe or loth.*        *willing or unwilling*<br>

But, lest that precious* folk be with me wroth,          *over-nice &lt;19&gt;<br>

How that he wrought I dare not to you tell,<br>

Or whether she thought it paradise or hell;<br>

But there I let them worken in their wise<br>

Till evensong ring, and they must arise.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01086">Were it by destiny, or aventure,*                               * chance<br>

Were it by influence, or by nature,<br>

Or constellation, that in such estate<br>

The heaven stood at that time fortunate<br>

As for to put a bill of Venus' works<br>

(For alle thing hath time, as say these clerks),<br>

To any woman for to get her love,<br>

I cannot say; but greate God above,<br>

That knoweth that none act is causeless,<br>

*He deem* of all, for I will hold my peace.              *let him judge*<br>

But sooth is this, how that this freshe May<br>

Hath taken such impression that day<br>

Of pity on this sicke Damian,<br>

That from her hearte she not drive can<br>

The remembrance for *to do him ease.*                        *to satisfy<br>

"Certain," thought she, "whom that this thing displease      his desire*<br>

I recke not, for here I him assure,<br>

To love him best of any creature,<br>

Though he no more haddee than his shirt."<br>

Lo, pity runneth soon in gentle heart.<br>

Here may ye see, how excellent franchise*                    *generosity<br>

In women is when they them *narrow advise.*           *closely consider*<br>

Some tyrant is, — as there be many a one, —<br>

That hath a heart as hard as any stone,<br>

Which would have let him sterven* in the place                      *die<br>

Well rather than have granted him her grace;<br>

And then rejoicen in her cruel pride.<br>

And reckon not to be a homicide.<br>

This gentle May, full filled of pity,<br>

Right of her hand a letter maked she,<br>

In which she granted him her very grace;<br>

There lacked nought, but only day and place,<br>

Where that she might unto his lust suffice:<br>

For it shall be right as he will devise.<br>

And when she saw her time upon a day<br>

To visit this Damian went this May,<br>

And subtilly this letter down she thrust<br>

Under his pillow, read it if him lust.*                         *pleased<br>

She took him by the hand, and hard him twist<br>

So secretly, that no wight of it wist,<br>

And bade him be all whole; and forth she went<br>

To January, when he for her sent.<br>

Up rose Damian the nexte morrow,<br>

All passed was his sickness and his sorrow.<br>

He combed him, he proined &lt;20&gt; him and picked,<br>

He did all that unto his lady liked;<br>

And eke to January he went as low<br>

As ever did a dogge for the bow.&lt;21&gt;<br>

He is so pleasant unto every man<br>

(For craft is all, whoso that do it can),<br>

Every wight is fain to speak him good;<br>

And fully in his lady's grace he stood.<br>

Thus leave I Damian about his need,<br>

And in my tale forth I will proceed.<br>

About that well, and danced, as men told.<br>

He in the garden them perform'd and sped.<br>

And in this wise many a merry day<br>

Such olde lewed* wordes used he.                      *foolish, ignorant<br>

On Damian a signe made she,<br>

That he should go before with his cliket.<br>

This Damian then hath opened the wicket,<br>

And in he start, and that in such mannere<br>

That no wight might him either see or hear;<br>

And still he sat under a bush. Anon<br>

This January, as blind as is a stone,<br>

With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo',<br>

Into this freshe garden is y-go,<br>

And clapped to the wicket suddenly.<br>

"Now, wife," quoth he, "here is but thou and I;<br>

Thou art the creature that I beste love:<br>

For, by that Lord that sits in heav'n above,<br>

Lever* I had to dien on a knife,                                 *rather<br>

Than thee offende, deare true wife.<br>

For Godde's sake, think how I thee chees,*                        *chose<br>

Not for no covetise* doubteless,                          * covetousness<br>

But only for the love I had to thee.<br>

And though that I be old, and may not see,<br>

Be to me true, and I will tell you why.<br>

Certes three thinges shall ye win thereby:<br>

First, love of Christ, and to yourself honour,<br>

And all mine heritage, town and tow'r.<br>

I give it you, make charters as you lest;<br>

This shall be done to-morrow ere sun rest,<br>

So wisly* God my soule bring to bliss!                           *surely<br>

That when that I consider your beauty,<br>

And therewithal *th'unlikely eld* of me,                *dissimilar age*<br>

I may not, certes, though I shoulde die,<br>

Forbear to be out of your company,<br>

For very love; this is withoute doubt:<br>

Now kiss me, wife, and let us roam about."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01091">This freshe May, when she these wordes heard,<br>

Benignely to January answer'd;<br>

But first and forward she began to weep:<br>

"I have," quoth she, "a soule for to keep<br>

As well as ye, and also mine honour,<br>

And of my wifehood thilke* tender flow'r                      *that same<br>

Which that I have assured in your hond,<br>

When that the priest to you my body bond:<br>

Wherefore I will answer in this mannere,<br>

With leave of you mine owen lord so dear.<br>

I pray to God, that never dawn the day<br>

That I *no sterve,* as foul as woman may,                   *do not die*<br>

If e'er I do unto my kin that shame,<br>

Or elles I impaire so my name,<br>

That I bee false; and if I do that lack,<br>

Do strippe me, and put me in a sack,<br>

And in the nexte river do me drench:*                             *drown<br>

I am a gentle woman, and no wench.<br>

Why speak ye thus? but men be e'er untrue,<br>

And women have reproof of you aye new.<br>

Ye know none other dalliance, I believe,<br>

But speak to us of untrust and repreve."*                       *reproof<br>

<p id="id01092">And with that word she saw where Damian<br>

Sat in the bush, and coughe she began;<br>

And with her finger signe made she,<br>

That Damian should climb upon a tree<br>

That charged was with fruit; and up he went:<br>

For verily he knew all her intent,<br>

And every signe that she coulde make,<br>

Better than January her own make.*                                 *mate<br>

For in a letter she had told him all<br>

Of this matter, how that he worke shall.<br>

And thus I leave him sitting in the perry,*                   *pear-tree<br>

And January and May roaming full merry.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01093">Bright was the day, and blue the firmament;<br>

Phoebus of gold his streames down had sent<br>

To gladden every flow'r with his warmness;<br>

He was that time in Geminis, I guess,<br>

But little from his declination<br>

Of Cancer, Jove's exaltation.<br>

And so befell, in that bright morning-tide,<br>

That in the garden, on the farther side,<br>

Pluto, that is the king of Faerie,<br>

And many a lady in his company<br>

Following his wife, the queen Proserpina, —<br>

Which that he ravished out of Ethna,&lt;26&gt;<br>

While that she gather'd flowers in the mead<br>

(In Claudian ye may the story read,<br>

How in his grisly chariot he her fet*), —                      *fetched<br>

This king of Faerie adown him set<br>

Upon a bank of turfes fresh and green,<br>

And right anon thus said he to his queen.<br>

"My wife," quoth he, "there may no wight say nay, —<br>

And Jesus, Filius Sirach, &lt;28&gt; as I guess,<br>

He spake of you but seldom reverence.<br>

A wilde fire and corrupt pestilence<br>

So fall upon your bodies yet to-night!<br>

Ne see ye not this honourable knight?<br>

Because, alas! that he is blind and old,<br>

His owen man shall make him cuckold.<br>

Lo, where he sits, the lechour, in the tree.<br>

Now by my mother Ceres' soul I swear<br>

That I shall give her suffisant answer,<br>

And alle women after, for her sake;<br>

That though they be in any guilt y-take,<br>

With face bold they shall themselves excuse,<br>

With martyrdom they proved their constance.<br>

Of many a very true wife also.<br>

Though that he said he found no good woman,<br>

Why make ye so much of Solomon?<br>

What though he made a temple, Godde's house?<br>

<p id="id01095">Now let us turn again to January,<br>

That in the garden with his faire May<br>

"You love I best, and shall, and other none."<br>

So long about the alleys is he gone,<br>

Till he was come to *that ilke perry,*              *the same pear-tree*<br>

Where as this Damian satte full merry<br>

On high, among the freshe leaves green.<br>

This freshe May, that is so bright and sheen,<br>

Gan for to sigh, and said, "Alas my side!<br>

Now, Sir," quoth she, "for aught that may betide,<br>

I must have of the peares that I see,<br>

Or I must die, so sore longeth me<br>

"For I am blind."  "Yea, Sir, *no force,"* quoth she;        *no matter*<br>

"But would ye vouchesafe, for Godde's sake,<br>

Then would I climbe well enough," quoth she,<br>

"So I my foot might set upon your back."<br>

"Certes," said he, "therein shall be no lack,<br>

Might I you helpe with mine hearte's blood."<br>

He stooped down, and on his back she stood,<br>

And caught her by a twist,* and up she go'th.               *twig, bough<br>

(Ladies, I pray you that ye be not wroth,<br>

I cannot glose,* I am a rude man):                        *mince matters<br>

And when that Pluto saw this greate wrong,<br>

To January he gave again his sight,<br>

And made him see as well as ever he might.<br>

And when he thus had caught his sight again,<br>

Was never man of anything so fain:<br>

But on his wife his thought was evermo'.<br>

Up to the tree he cast his eyen two,<br>

And saw how Damian his wife had dress'd,<br>

In such mannere, it may not be express'd,<br>

*But if* I woulde speak uncourteously.                          *unless*<br>

Was nothing better for to make you see,<br>

Than struggle with a man upon a tree:<br>

"Struggle!" quoth he, "yea, algate* in it went.            *whatever way<br>

But, by my father's soul, I ween'd have seen<br>

How that this Damian had by thee lain,<br>

And that thy smock had lain upon his breast."<br>

"Yea, Sir," quoth she, "ye may *ween as ye lest:*          *think as you<br>

And with that word she leapt down from the tree.<br>

This January, who is glad but he?<br>

He kissed her, and clipped* her full oft,                      *embraced<br>

And on her womb he stroked her full soft;<br>

And to his palace home he hath her lad.*                            *led<br>

Now, goode men, I pray you to be glad.<br>

<p id="id01097" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to The Merchant's Tale</p>

<p id="id01098" style="margin-top: 2em">1. If, as is probable, this Tale was translated from the French,
the original is not now extant. Tyrwhitt remarks that the scene
"is laid in Italy, but none of the names, except Damian and
Justin, seem to be Italian,  but rather made at pleasure; so that I
doubt whether the story be really of Italian growth. The
adventure of the pear-tree I find in a small collection of Latin
fables, written by one Adoiphus, in elegiac verses of his fashion,
in the year 1315. . . . Whatever was the real origin of the Tale,
the machinery of the fairies, which Chaucer has used so happily,
was probably added by himself; and, indeed, I cannot help
thinking that his Pluto and Proserpina were the true progenitors
of Oberon and Titania; or rather, that they themselves have,
once at least, deigned to revisit our poetical system under the
latter names."</p>

<p id="id01099">2. Seculeres: of the laity; but perhaps, since the word is of two-
fold meaning, Chaucer intends a hit at the secular clergy, who,
unlike the regular orders, did not live separate from the world,
but shared in all its interests and pleasures — all the more easily
and freely, that they had not the civil restraint of marriage.</p>

<p id="id01100">3. This and the next eight lines are taken from the "Liber
aureolus Theophrasti de nuptiis," ("Theophrastus's Golden
Book of Marriage") quoted by Hieronymus, "Contra
Jovinianum," ("Against Jovinian") and thence again by John of
Salisbury.</p>

<p id="id01101">4. Mebles: movables, furniture, &amp;c.; French, "meubles."</p>

<p id="id01102">5. "Wade's boat" was called Guingelot; and in it, according to
the old romance, the owner underwent a long series of wild
adventures, and performed many strange exploits.  The romance
is lost, and therefore  the exact force of the phrase in the text is
uncertain; but Mr Wright seems to be warranted in supposing
that Wade's adventures were cited as examples of craft and
cunning — that the hero, in fact, was a kind of Northern
Ulysses,  It is possible that to the same source we may trace the
proverbial phrase, found in Chaucer's "Remedy of Love," to
"bear Wattis pack" signifying to be duped or beguiled.</p>

<p id="id01103">6. Stopen: advanced; past participle of "step." Elsewhere
"y-stept in age" is used by Chaucer.</p>

<p id="id01104">7. They did not need to go in quest of a wife for him, as they
had promised.</p>

<p id="id01105">8. Thilke tree: that tree of original sin, of which the special sins
are the branches.</p>

<p id="id01106">9. Skinked:  poured out; from Anglo-Saxon, "scencan."</p>

<p id="id01107">10. Marcianus Capella, who wrote a kind of philosophical
romance, "De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae" (Of the Marriage
of Mercury and Philology) . "Her" and "him," two lines after,
like "he" applied to Theodomas, are prefixed to the proper
names for emphasis, according to the Anglo- Saxon usage.</p>

<p id="id01108">11. Familiar: domestic; belonging to the "familia," or household.</p>

<p id="id01109">12. Hewe: domestic servant; from Anglo-Saxon, "hiwa."
Tyrwhitt reads "false of holy hue;" but Mr Wright has properly
restored the reading adopted in the text.</p>

<p id="id01110">13. Boren man: born; owing to January faith and loyalty
because born in his household.</p>

<p id="id01111">14. Hippocras: spiced wine. Clarre: also a kind of spiced wine.
Vernage: a wine believed to have come from Crete, although its
name — Italian,  "Vernaccia" — seems to be derived from
Verona.</p>

<p id="id01112">15. Dan Constantine: a medical author who wrote about 1080;
his works were printed at Basle in 1536.</p>

<p id="id01113">16. Full of jargon as a flecked pie: he chattered like a magpie</p>

<p id="id01114">17. Nearly all the manuscripts read "in two of Taure;" but
Tyrwhitt has shown that, setting out from the second degree of
Taurus, the moon, which in the four complete days that Maius
spent in her chamber could not have advanced more than fifty-
three degrees, would only have been at the twenty-fifth degree
of Gemini — whereas, by reading "ten," she is brought to the
third degree of Cancer.</p>

<p id="id01115">18. Kid; or "kidde," past participle of  "kythe" or "kithe," to
show or discover.</p>

<p id="id01116">19. Precious:  precise, over-nice; French, "precieux," affected.</p>

<p id="id01117">20. Proined: or "pruned;" carefully trimmed and dressed
himself. The word is used in falconry of a hawk when she picks
and trims her feathers.</p>

<p id="id01118">21. A dogge for the bow: a dog attending a hunter with the
bow.</p>

<p id="id01119">22  The Romance of the Rose: a very popular mediaeval
romance, the English version of which is partly by Chaucer. It
opens with a description of a beautiful garden.</p>

<p id="id01120">23. Priapus:  Son of Bacchus and Venus: he was regarded as
the promoter of fertility in all agricultural life, vegetable and
animal; while not only gardens, but fields, flocks, bees — and
even fisheries — were supposed to be under his protection.</p>

<p id="id01121">24. Argus was employed by Juno to watch Io with his hundred
eyes but he was sent to sleep by the flute of Mercury, who then
cut off his head.</p>

<p id="id01122">25. "My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my
fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is past, the rain is
over and gone: The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the
singing of the birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard
in our land."
— Song of Solomon, ii. 10-12.</p>

<p id="id01123">26.                "That fair field,<br>

Of Enna, where Proserpine, gath'ring flowers,<br>

Herself a fairer flow'r, by gloomy Dis<br>

Was gather'd."<br>

— Milton, Paradise Lost, iv. 268<br>
</p>

<p id="id01124">27. "Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one
by one, to find out the account:
Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man amongst a
thousand have I found, but a woman among all those I have not

Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright."
Ecclesiastes vii. 27-29.</p>

<p id="id01125">28. Jesus, the son of Sirach, to whom is ascribed one of the
books of the Apochrypha — that called the "Wisdom of Jesus
the Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus;"  in which, especially in the
ninth and twenty-fifth chapters, severe cautions are given
against women.</p>

<p id="id01126">29. Roman gestes: histories; such as those of Lucretia, Porcia,
&amp;c.</p>

<p id="id01127">30. May means January to believe that she is pregnant, and that
she has a craving for unripe pears.</p>

<p id="id01128">31. At this point, and again some twenty lines below, several
verses of a very coarse character had been inserted in later
manuscripts; but they are evidently spurious, and are omitted in
the best editions.</p>

<p id="id01129">32. "Store" is the general reading here, but its meaning is not
obvious.  "Stowre" is found in several manuscripts; it signifies
"struggle" or "resist;" and both for its own appropriateness, and
for the force which it gives the word "stronge," the reading in
the text seems the better.</p>

<p id="id01137">At Sarra, in the land of Tartary,<br>

There dwelt a king that warrayed* Russie, &lt;2&gt;               *made war on<br>

Through which there died many a doughty man;<br>

This noble king was called Cambuscan,&lt;3&gt;<br>

Which in his time was of so great renown,<br>

That there was nowhere in no regioun<br>

So excellent a lord in alle thing:<br>

Him lacked nought that longeth to a king,<br>

As of the sect of which that he was born.<br>

He kept his law to which he was y-sworn,<br>

And thereto* he was hardy, wise, and rich,            *moreover, besides<br>

And piteous and just, always y-lich;*              *alike, even-tempered<br>

True of his word, benign and honourable;<br>

*Of his corage as any centre stable;*        *firm, immovable of spirit*<br>

Young, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous<br>

As any bachelor of all his house.<br>

A fair person he was, and fortunate,<br>

And kept alway so well his royal estate,<br>

That there was nowhere such another man.<br>

This noble king, this Tartar Cambuscan,<br>

Hadde two sons by Elfeta his wife,<br>

Of which the eldest highte Algarsife,<br>

The other was y-called Camballo.<br>

A daughter had this worthy king also,<br>

That youngest was, and highte Canace:<br>

But for to telle you all her beauty,<br>

It lies not in my tongue, nor my conning;*                        *skill<br>

I dare not undertake so high a thing:<br>

Mine English eke is insufficient,<br>

It muste be a rhetor* excellent,                                 *orator<br>

*That couth his colours longing for that art,*                * see &lt;4&gt;*<br>

If he should her describen any part;<br>

I am none such, I must speak as I can.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01138">And so befell, that when this Cambuscan<br>

Had twenty winters borne his diadem,<br>

As he was wont from year to year, I deem,<br>

He let *the feast of his nativity*                  *his birthday party*<br>

*Do crye,* throughout Sarra his city,                    *be proclaimed*<br>

The last Idus of March, after the year.<br>

Phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear,<br>

For he was nigh his exaltation<br>

In Marte's face, and in his mansion &lt;5&gt;<br>

In Aries, the choleric hot sign:<br>

Full lusty* was the weather and benign;                        *pleasant<br>

For which the fowls against the sunne sheen,*                    *bright<br>

What for the season and the younge green,<br>

Full loude sange their affections:<br>

Them seemed to have got protections<br>

Against the sword of winter keen and cold.<br>

This Cambuscan, of which I have you told,<br>

In royal vesture, sat upon his dais,<br>

With diadem, full high in his palace;<br>

And held his feast so solemn and so rich,<br>

That in this worlde was there none it lich.*                       *like<br>

Of which if I should tell all the array,<br>

Then would it occupy a summer's day;<br>

And eke it needeth not for to devise*                          *describe<br>

At every course the order of service.<br>

I will not tellen of their strange sewes,*                   *dishes &lt;6&gt;<br>

Nor of their swannes, nor their heronsews.*            *young herons &lt;7&gt;<br>

Eke in that land, as telle knightes old,<br>

There is some meat that is full dainty hold,<br>

That in this land men *reck of* it full small:                *care for*<br>

There is no man that may reporten all.<br>

I will not tarry you, for it is prime,<br>

And for it is no fruit, but loss of time;<br>

Unto my purpose* I will have recourse.                        *story &lt;8&gt;<br>

And so befell that, after the third course,<br>

While that this king sat thus in his nobley,*               *noble array<br>

Hearing his ministreles their thinges play<br>

Before him at his board deliciously,<br>

In at the halle door all suddenly<br>

There came a knight upon a steed of brass,<br>

And in his hand a broad mirror of glass;<br>

Upon his thumb he had of gold a ring,<br>

And by his side a naked sword hanging:<br>

And up he rode unto the highe board.<br>

In all the hall was there not spoke a word,<br>

For marvel of this knight; him to behold<br>

Full busily they waited,* young and old.                        *watched<br>
</p>

<p id="id01139">This strange knight, that came thus suddenly,<br>

All armed, save his head, full richely,<br>

Saluted king, and queen, and lordes all,<br>

By order as they satten in the hall,<br>

With so high reverence and observance,<br>

As well in speech as in his countenance,<br>

That Gawain &lt;9&gt; with his olde courtesy,<br>

Though he were come again out of Faerie,<br>

Him *coulde not amende with a word.*               *could not better him<br>

And after this, before the highe board,                     by one word*<br>

He with a manly voice said his message,<br>

After the form used in his language,<br>

Withoute vice* of syllable or letter.                             *fault<br>

And, for his tale shoulde seem the better,<br>

Accordant to his worde's was his cheer,*                      *demeanour<br>

As teacheth art of speech them that it lear.*                     *learn<br>

Albeit that I cannot sound his style,<br>

Nor cannot climb over so high a stile,<br>

Yet say I this, as to *commune intent,*       *general sense or meaning*<br>

*Thus much amounteth* all that ever he meant,       *this is the sum of*<br>

If it so be that I have it in mind.<br>

He said; "The king of Araby and Ind,<br>

My liege lord, on this solemne day<br>

Saluteth you as he best can and may,<br>

And sendeth you, in honour of your feast,<br>

By me, that am all ready at your hest,*                         *command<br>

This steed of brass, that easily and well<br>

Can in the space of one day naturel<br>

(This is to say, in four-and-twenty hours),<br>

Whereso you list, in drought or else in show'rs,<br>

Beare your body into every place<br>

To which your hearte willeth for to pace,*                     *pass, go<br>

Withoute wem* of you, through foul or fair.                *hurt, injury<br>

Or if you list to fly as high in air<br>

As doth an eagle, when him list to soar,<br>

This same steed shall bear you evermore<br>

Withoute harm, till ye be where *you lest*              *it pleases you*<br>

(Though that ye sleepen on his back, or rest),<br>

And turn again, with writhing* of a pin.                       *twisting<br>

He that it wrought, he coude* many a gin;**     *knew **contrivance &lt;10&gt;<br>

He waited* in any a constellation,                             *observed<br>

Ere he had done this operation,<br>

And knew full many a seal &lt;11&gt; and many a bond<br>

This mirror eke, that I have in mine hond,<br>

Hath such a might, that men may in it see<br>

When there shall fall any adversity<br>

Unto your realm, or to yourself also,<br>

And openly who is your friend or foe.<br>

And over all this, if any lady bright<br>

Hath set her heart on any manner wight,<br>

If he be false, she shall his treason see,<br>

His newe love, and all his subtlety,<br>

So openly that there shall nothing hide.<br>

Wherefore, against this lusty summer-tide,<br>

This mirror, and this ring that ye may see,<br>

He hath sent to my lady Canace,<br>

Your excellente daughter that is here.<br>

The virtue of this ring, if ye will hear,<br>

Is this, that if her list it for to wear<br>

Upon her thumb, or in her purse it bear,<br>

There is no fowl that flyeth under heaven,<br>

That she shall not well understand his steven,*           *speech, sound<br>

And know his meaning openly and plain,<br>

And answer him in his language again:<br>

And every grass that groweth upon root<br>

She shall eke know, to whom it will do boot,*                    *remedy<br>

All be his woundes ne'er so deep and wide.<br>

This naked sword, that hangeth by my side,<br>

Such virtue hath, that what man that it smite,<br>

Throughout his armour it will carve and bite,<br>

Were it as thick as is a branched oak:<br>

And what man is y-wounded with the stroke<br>

Shall ne'er be whole, till that you list, of grace,<br>

To stroke him with the flat in thilke* place                   *the same<br>

Where he is hurt; this is as much to sayn,<br>

Ye muste with the flatte sword again<br>

Stroke him upon the wound, and it will close.<br>

This is the very sooth, withoute glose;*                         *deceit<br>

It faileth not, while it is in your hold."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01140">And when this knight had thus his tale told,<br>

He rode out of the hall, and down he light.<br>

Stood in the court as still as any stone.<br>

<p id="id01143">At after supper went this noble king<br>

To see the horse of brass, with all a rout<br>

Of lordes and of ladies him about.<br>

Such wond'ring was there on this horse of brass,<br>

That, since the great siege of Troye was,<br>

There as men wonder'd on a horse also,<br>

Ne'er was there such a wond'ring as was tho.*                     *there<br>

But finally the king asked the knight<br>

The virtue of this courser, and the might,<br>

And prayed him to tell his governance.*            *mode of managing him<br>

The horse anon began to trip and dance,<br>

When that the knight laid hand upon his rein,<br>

And saide, "Sir, there is no more to sayn,<br>

But when you list to riden anywhere,<br>

Ye muste trill* a pin, stands in his ear,                     *turn &lt;23&gt;<br>

Which I shall telle you betwixt us two;<br>

Ye muste name him to what place also,<br>

Or to what country that you list to ride.<br>

And when ye come where you list abide,<br>

Bid him descend, and trill another pin<br>

(For therein lies th' effect of all the gin*),         *contrivance &lt;10&gt;<br>

And he will down descend and do your will,<br>

And in that place he will abide still;<br>

Though all the world had the contrary swore,<br>

He shall not thence be throwen nor be bore.<br>

Or, if you list to bid him thennes gon,<br>

Trill this pin, and he will vanish anon<br>

Out of the sight of every manner wight,<br>

And come again, be it by day or night,<br>

When that you list to clepe* him again                             *call<br>

In such a guise, as I shall to you sayn<br>

Betwixte you and me, and that full soon.<br>

Ride &lt;24&gt; when you list, there is no more to do'n.'<br>

Informed when the king was of the knight,<br>

And had conceived in his wit aright<br>

The manner and the form of all this thing,<br>

Full glad and blithe, this noble doughty king<br>

Repaired to his revel as beforn.<br>

The bridle is into the tower borne,<br>

And kept among his jewels lefe* and dear;                     *cherished<br>

The horse vanish'd, I n'ot* in what mannere,                   *know not<br>

Out of their sight; ye get no more of me:<br>

But thus I leave in lust and jollity<br>

This Cambuscan his lordes feastying,*                 *entertaining &lt;25&gt;<br>

For such a joy she in her hearte took<br>

Both of her quainte a ring and her mirrour,.<br>

<p id="id01147">Amid a tree fordry*, as white as chalk,             *thoroughly dried up<br>

There sat a falcon o'er her head full high,<br>

That with a piteous voice so gan to cry;<br>

That all the wood resounded of her cry,<br>

And beat she had herself so piteously<br>

With both her winges, till the redde blood<br>

Ran endelong* the tree, there as she stood           *from top to bottom<br>

That dwelleth either in wood or in forest;<br>

But would have wept, if that he weepe could,<br>

For sorrow of her; she shriek'd alway so loud.<br>

For there was never yet no man alive,<br>

If that he could a falcon well descrive;*                      *describe<br>

As well of plumage, as of gentleness;<br>

Of shape, of all that mighte reckon'd be.<br>

A falcon peregrine seemed she,<br>

Of fremde* land; and ever as she stood                     *foreign &lt;28&gt;<br>

She swooned now and now for lack of blood;<br>

Till well-nigh is she fallen from the tree.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01148">This faire kinge's daughter Canace,<br>

A longe while to waite her she stood;<br>

Till at the last she apake in this mannere<br>

Unto the hawk, as ye shall after hear:<br>

"What is the cause, if it be for to tell,<br>

That ye be in this furial* pain of hell?"               *raging, furious<br>

Quoth Canace unto this hawk above;<br>

"Is this for sorrow of of death; or loss of love?<br>

Then shriek'd this falcon yet more piteously<br>

Than ever she did, and fell to ground anon,<br>

And lay aswoon, as dead as lies a stone,<br>

Till Canace had in her lap her take,<br>

Unto that time she gan of swoon awake:<br>

And, after that she out of swoon abraid,*                         *awoke<br>

Right in her hawke's leden thus she said:<br>

Under pleasance, and under busy pain,<br>

So deep in grain he dyed his colours.<br>

Right as a serpent hides him under flow'rs,<br>

Till he may see his time for to bite,<br>

That, save the fiend, none wiste what he meant:<br>

Till he so long had weeped and complain'd,<br>

And many a year his service to me feign'd,<br>

Till that mine heart, too piteous and too nice,*        *foolish, simple<br>

All innocent of his crowned malice,<br>

*Forfeared of his death,* as thoughte me,           *greatly afraid lest<br>

Upon his oathes and his surety                            he should die*<br>

That evermore mine honour and renown<br>

Were saved, bothe *privy and apert;*           *privately and in public*<br>

This is to say, that, after his desert,<br>

I gave him all my heart and all my thought<br>

(God wot, and he, that *other wayes nought*),          *in no other way*<br>

And took his heart in change of mine for aye.<br>

But sooth is said, gone since many a day,<br>

And when he saw the thing so far y-gone,<br>

That I had granted him fully my love,<br>

In such a wise as I have said above,<br>

And given him my true heart as free<br>

As he swore that he gave his heart to me,<br>

Anon this tiger, full of doubleness,<br>

With so high reverence, as by his cheer,*                          *mien<br>

His manner was a heaven for to see<br>

To any woman, were she ne'er so wise;<br>

So painted he and kempt,* *at point devise,*            *combed, studied<br>

As well his wordes as his countenance.          *with perfect precision*<br>

And I so lov'd him for his obeisance,<br>

That, if so were that any thing him smart,*                      *pained<br>

<p id="id01153" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Squire's Tale</p>

<p id="id01154" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The Squire's Tale has not been found under any other form
among the literary remains of the Middle Ages; and it is
unknown from what original it was derived, if from any. The
Tale is unfinished, not because the conclusion has been lost, but
because the author left it so.</p>

<p id="id01155">2. The Russians and Tartars waged constant hostilities between
the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p id="id01156">3. In the best manuscripts the name is "Cambynskan," and thus,
no doubt, it should strictly be read. But it is a most pardonable
offence against literal accuracy to use the word which Milton
has made classical, in "Il Penseroso," speaking of</p>

<p id="id01157">           "him that left half-told<br>

The story of Cambuscan bold,<br>

Of Camball, and of Algarsife,<br>

And who had Canace to wife,<br>

That owned the virtuous Ring and Glass,<br>

And of the wondrous Horse of Brass,<br>

On which the Tartar King did ride"<br>
</p>

<p id="id01158">Surely the admiration of Milton might well seem to the spirit of
Chaucer to condone a much greater transgression on his domain
than this verbal change — which to both eye and ear is an
unquestionable improvement on the uncouth original.</p>

<p id="id01159">4. Couth his colours longing for that art: well skilled in using
the colours — the word-painting — belonging to his art.</p>

<p id="id01160">5. Aries was the mansion of Mars — to whom "his" applies.
Leo was the mansion of the Sun.</p>

<p id="id01161">6. Sewes:  Dishes, or soups. The precise force of the word is
uncertain; but it may be connected with "seethe," to boil, and it
seems to describe a dish in which the flesh was served up amid a
kind of broth or gravy. The "sewer," taster or assayer of the
viands served at great tables, probably derived his name from
the verb to "say" or "assay;" though Tyrwhitt would connect
the two words, by taking both from the French, "asseoir," to
place — making the arrangement of the table the leading duty of
the "sewer," rather than the testing of the food.</p>

<p id="id01162">7. Heronsews: young herons; French, "heronneaux."</p>

<p id="id01163">8. Purpose: story, discourse; French, "propos."</p>

<p id="id01164">9. Gawain was celebrated in mediaeval romance as the most
courteous among King Arthur's knights.</p>

<p id="id01165">10. Gin: contrivance; trick; snare. Compare Italian, "inganno,"
deception; and our own "engine."</p>

<p id="id01166">11. Mr Wright remarks that "the making and arrangement of
seals was one of the important operations of mediaeval magic."</p>

<p id="id01167">12. Remued: removed; French, "remuer," to stir.</p>

<p id="id01168">13. Polies:  Apulian. The horses of Apulia — in old French
"Poille," in Italian "Puglia" — were held in high value.</p>

<p id="id01169">14. The Greeke's horse Sinon: the wooden horse of the Greek
Sinon, introduced  into Troy by the stratagem of its maker.</p>

<p id="id01170">15. Master tower: chief tower; as, in the Knight's Tale, the
principal street is called the "master street."  See note 86 to the
Knight's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01171">16. Alhazen and Vitellon: two writers on optics — the first
supposed to have lived about 1100, the other about 1270.
Tyrwhitt says that their works were printed at Basle in 1572,
under the title "Alhazeni et Vitellonis Opticae."</p>

<p id="id01172">17. Telephus, a son of Hercules, reigned over Mysia when the
Greeks came to besiege Troy, and he sought to prevent their
landing.  But, by the art of Dionysus, he was made to stumble
over a vine, and Achilles wounded him with his spear.  The
oracle informed Telephus that the hurt could be healed only by
him, or by the weapon, that inflicted it; and the king, seeking
the Grecian camp, was healed by Achilles with the rust of the
charmed spear.</p>

<p id="id01173">18. Ferne: before; a corruption of "forne," from Anglo-Saxon,
"foran."</p>

<p id="id01174">19. Aldrian: or Aldebaran; a star in the neck of the constellation
Leo.</p>

<p id="id01175">20. Chamber of parements:  Presence-chamber, or chamber of
state, full of  splendid furniture and ornaments. The same
expression is used in French and Italian.</p>

<p id="id01176">21. In Pisces, Venus was said to be at her exaltation or greatest
power. A planet, according to the old astrologers, was in
"exaltation" when in the sign of the Zodiac in which it exerted
its strongest influence; the opposite sign, in which it was
weakest, was called its "dejection."</p>

<p id="id01177">22. Launcelot:  Arthur's famous knight, so accomplished and
courtly, that he was held the very pink of chivalry.</p>

<p id="id01178">23. Trill: turn;  akin to "thirl", "drill."</p>

<p id="id01179">24. Ride: another reading is "bide," alight or remain.</p>

<p id="id01180">25. Feastying: entertaining; French, "festoyer,"  to feast.</p>

<p id="id01181">26. The old physicians held that blood dominated in  the human
body late at night and in the early morning.  Galen says that the
domination lasts for seven hours.</p>

<p id="id01182">27. Fumosity: fumes of wine rising from the stomach to the
head.</p>

<p id="id01183">28. Fremde: foreign, strange; German, "fremd" in the northern
dialects, "frem," or "fremmed," is used in the same sense.</p>

<p id="id01184">29. Leden: Language, dialect; from Anglo-Saxon, "leden" or
"laeden," a corruption from "Latin."</p>

<p id="id01185">30. Tercelet: the "tassel," or male of any species of hawk; so
called, according to Cotgrave, because he is one third ("tiers")
smaller than the female.</p>

<p id="id01186">31. "And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the
one Adah, and the name of the other Zillah" (Gen. iv. 19).</p>

<p id="id01187">32. Galoche:  shoe; it seems to have been used in France, of a
"sabot," or wooden shoe.  The reader cannot fail to recall the
same illustration in John i. 27, where the Baptist says of Christ:
"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me; whose
shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose."</p>

<p id="id01188">33. Byleve; stay; another form is "bleve;" from Anglo-Saxon,
"belitan," to remain.  Compare German, "bleiben."</p>

<p id="id01189">34. This sentiment, as well as the illustration of the bird which
follows, is taken from the third book of Boethius, "De
Consolatione Philosophiae," metrum 2. It has thus been
rendered in Chaucer's translation: "All things seek aye to their
proper course, and all things rejoice on their returning again to
their nature."</p>

<p id="id01190">35. Men love of proper kind newfangleness: Men, by their own
— their very — nature, are fond of novelty, and prone to
inconstancy.</p>

<p id="id01191">36. Blue was the colour of truth, as green was that of
inconstancy.  In John Stowe's additions to Chaucer's works,
printed in 1561, there is "A balade whiche Chaucer made
against women inconstaunt," of which the refrain is, "In stead of
blue, thus may ye wear all green."</p>

<p id="id01192">37. Unless we suppose this to be a namesake of the Camballo
who was Canace's brother — which is not at all probable — we
must agree with Tyrwhitt that there is a mistake here; which no
doubt Chaucer would have rectified, if the tale had not been
"left half-told," One manuscript reads "Caballo;" and though not
much authority need be given to a difference that may be due to
mere omission of the mark of contraction over the "a," there is
enough in the text to show that another person than the king's
younger son is intended.  The Squire promises to tell the
adventures that befell each member of Cambuscan's family; and
in thorough consistency with this plan, and with the canons of
chivalric story, would be "the marriage of Canace to some
knight who was first obliged to fight for her with her two
brethren; a method of courtship," adds Tyrwhitt, "very
consonant to the spirit of ancient chivalry."</p>

<p id="id01193">38. (Trancriber's note) In some manuscripts the following two
lines, being the beginning of the third part, are found: -</p>

<p id="id01194">Apollo whirleth up his chair so high,<br>

Till that Mercurius' house, the sly…<br>

<p id="id01200" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Franklin's Tale</p>

<p id="id01201" style="margin-top: 2em">1. In the older editions, the verses here given as the prologue
were prefixed to the Merchant's Tale, and put into his mouth.
Tyrwhitt was abundantly justified, by the internal evidence
afforded by the lines themselves, in transferring them to their
present place.</p>

<p id="id01202">2. The "Breton Lays" were an important and curious element in
the literature of the Middle Ages; they were originally
composed in the Armorican language, and the chief collection
of them extant was translated into French verse by a poetess
calling herself "Marie," about the middle of the thirteenth
century.  But though this collection was the most famous, and
had doubtless been read by Chaucer, there were other British or
Breton lays, and from one of those the Franklin's Tale is taken.
Boccaccio has dealt with the same story in the "Decameron"
and the "Philocopo,"  altering the circumstances to suit the
removal of its scene to a southern clime.</p>

<h4 id="id01203" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE.</h4>

<p id="id01204" style="margin-top: 2em">In Armoric', that called is Bretagne,<br>

There was a knight, that lov'd and *did his pain*      *devoted himself,<br>

To serve a lady in his beste wise;                               strove*<br>

And many a labour, many a great emprise,*                    *enterprise<br>

He for his lady wrought, ere she were won:<br>

For she was one the fairest under sun,<br>

And eke thereto come of so high kindred,<br>

That *well unnethes durst this knight for dread,*         *see note &lt;1&gt;*<br>

Tell her his woe, his pain, and his distress<br>

But, at the last, she for his worthiness,<br>

And namely* for his meek obeisance,                          *especially<br>

Hath such a pity caught of his penance,*            *suffering, distress<br>

That privily she fell of his accord<br>

To take him for her husband and her lord<br>

(Of such lordship as men have o'er their wives);<br>

And, for to lead the more in bliss their lives,<br>

Of his free will he swore her as a knight,<br>

That never in all his life he day nor night<br>

Should take upon himself no mastery<br>

Against her will, nor kithe* her jealousy,                         *show<br>

But her obey, and follow her will in all,<br>

As any lover to his lady shall;<br>

Save that the name of sovereignety<br>

That would he have, for shame of his degree.<br>

She thanked him, and with full great humbless<br>

She saide; "Sir, since of your gentleness<br>

Ye proffer me to have so large a reign,<br>

*Ne woulde God never betwixt us twain,<br>

As in my guilt, were either war or strife:*               *see note &lt;2&gt;*<br>

Sir, I will be your humble true wife,<br>

Have here my troth, till that my hearte brest."*                  *burst<br>

Thus be they both in quiet and in rest.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01205">For one thing, Sires, safely dare I say,<br>

That friends ever each other must obey,<br>

If they will longe hold in company.<br>

Love will not be constrain'd by mastery.<br>

When mast'ry comes, the god of love anon<br>

Beateth &lt;3&gt; his wings, and, farewell, he is gone.<br>

Love is a thing as any spirit free.<br>

Women *of kind* desire liberty,                              *by nature*<br>

And not to be constrained as a thrall,*                           *slave<br>

Look who that is most patient in love,<br>

He *is at his advantage all above.*                  *enjoys the highest<br>

That never should there be default in her.<br>

Here may men see a humble wife accord;<br>

Thus hath she ta'en her servant and her lord,<br>

Servant in love, and lord in marriage.<br>

Then was he both in lordship and servage?<br>

Servage? nay, but in lordship all above,<br>

Since he had both his lady and his love:<br>

His lady certes, and his wife also,<br>

The which that law of love accordeth to.<br>

And when he was in this prosperrity,<br>

Home with his wife he went to his country,<br>

Not far from Penmark,&lt;4&gt; where his dwelling was,<br>

And there he liv'd in bliss and in solace.*                     *delight<br>

(For all his lust* he set in such labour);                     *pleasure<br>

And dwelled there two years; the book saith thus.<br>

They preache her, they tell her night and day,<br>

But when she saw the grisly rockes blake,*                        *black<br>

For very fear so would her hearte quake,<br>

That on her feet she might her not sustene*                     *sustain<br>

Then would she sit adown upon the green,<br>

And piteously *into the sea behold,*               *look out on the sea*<br>

And say right thus, with *careful sikes* cold:           *painful sighs*<br>

"Eternal God! that through thy purveyance<br>

Leadest this world by certain governance,<br>

*In idle,* as men say, ye nothing make;                  *idly, in vain*<br>

But, Lord, these grisly fiendly rockes blake,<br>

That seem rather a foul confusion<br>

Of work, than any fair creation<br>

Of such a perfect wise God and stable,<br>

Why have ye wrought this work unreasonable?<br>

For by this work, north, south, or west, or east,<br>

There is not foster'd man, nor bird, nor beast:<br>

It doth no good, to my wit, but *annoyeth.*         *works mischief* &lt;7&gt;<br>

See ye not, Lord, how mankind it destroyeth?<br>

A hundred thousand bodies of mankind<br>

Have rockes slain, *all be they not in mind;*           *though they are<br>

Which mankind is so fair part of thy work,                    forgotten*<br>

Thou madest it like to thine owen mark.*                          *image<br>

Then seemed it ye had a great cherte*                   *love, affection<br>

Toward mankind; but how then may it be<br>

That ye such meanes make it to destroy?<br>

Which meanes do no good, but ever annoy.<br>

I wot well, clerkes will say as them lest,*                      *please<br>

By arguments, that all is for the best,<br>

Although I can the causes not y-know;<br>

But thilke* God that made the wind to blow,                        *that<br>

As keep my lord, this is my conclusion:<br>

To clerks leave I all disputation:<br>

But would to God that all these rockes blake<br>

Were sunken into helle for his sake<br>

These rockes slay mine hearte for the fear."<br>

Thus would she say, with many a piteous tear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01208">Her friendes saw that it was no disport<br>

To roame by the sea, but discomfort,<br>

And shope* them for to playe somewhere else.                   *arranged<br>

They leade her by rivers and by wells,<br>

And eke in other places delectables;<br>

They dancen, and they play at chess and tables.*             *backgammon<br>

So on a day, right in the morning-tide,<br>

Unto a garden that was there beside,<br>

In which that they had made their ordinance*     *provision, arrangement<br>

Of victual, and of other purveyance,<br>

They go and play them all the longe day:<br>

And this was on the sixth morrow of May,<br>

Which May had painted with his softe showers<br>

This garden full of leaves and of flowers:<br>

And craft of manne's hand so curiously<br>

Arrayed had this garden truely,<br>

That never was there garden of such price,*               *value, praise<br>

*But if* it were the very Paradise.                             *unless*<br>

Th'odour of flowers, and the freshe sight,<br>

Would have maked any hearte light<br>

That e'er was born, *but if* too great sickness                 *unless*<br>

Or too great sorrow held it in distress;<br>

So full it was of beauty and pleasance.<br>

And after dinner they began to dance<br>

And sing also, save Dorigen alone<br>

Who made alway her complaint and her moan,<br>

For she saw not him on the dance go<br>

That was her husband, and her love also;<br>

But natheless she must a time abide<br>

And with good hope let her sorrow slide.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01209">Upon this dance, amonge other men,<br>

Danced a squier before Dorigen<br>

That fresher was, and jollier of array<br>

*As to my doom,* than is the month of May.              *in my judgment*<br>

He sang and danced, passing any man,<br>

That is or was since that the world began;<br>

Therewith he was, if men should him descrive,<br>

One of the *beste faring* men alive,                 *most accomplished*<br>

Young, strong, and virtuous, and rich, and wise,<br>

And well beloved, and holden in great price.*             *esteem, value<br>

And, shortly if the sooth I telle shall,<br>

*Unweeting of* this Dorigen at all,                         *unknown to*<br>

This lusty squier, servant to Venus,<br>

Which that y-called was Aurelius,<br>

Had lov'd her best of any creature<br>

Two year and more, as was his aventure;*                        *fortune<br>

But never durst he tell her his grievance;<br>

Withoute cup he drank all his penance.<br>

He was despaired, nothing durst he say,<br>

Save in his songes somewhat would he wray*                       *betray<br>

His woe, as in a general complaining;<br>

He said, he lov'd, and was belov'd nothing.<br>

Of suche matter made he many lays,<br>

Songes, complaintes, roundels, virelays &lt;8&gt;<br>

How that he durste not his sorrow tell,<br>

But languished, as doth a Fury in hell;<br>

And die he must, he said, as did Echo<br>

For Narcissus, that durst not tell her woe.<br>

In other manner than ye hear me say,<br>

He durste not to her his woe bewray,<br>

Save that paraventure sometimes at dances,<br>

Where younge folke keep their observances,<br>

It may well be he looked on her face<br>

In such a wise, as man that asketh grace,<br>

But nothing wiste she of his intent.<br>

Nath'less it happen'd, ere they thennes* went,         *thence (from the<br>

Because that he was her neighebour,                             garden)*<br>

And was a man of worship and honour,<br>

And she had knowen him *of time yore,*                 *for a long time*<br>

They fell in speech, and forth aye more and more<br>

Unto his purpose drew Aurelius;<br>

And when he saw his time, he saide thus:<br>

Madam," quoth he, "by God that this world made,<br>

So that I wist it might your hearte glade,*                     *gladden<br>

I would, that day that your Arviragus<br>

Went over sea, that I, Aurelius,<br>

Had gone where I should never come again;<br>

For well I wot my service is in vain.<br>

My guerdon* is but bursting of mine heart.                       *reward<br>

Madame, rue upon my paine's smart,<br>

For with a word ye may me slay or save.<br>

Here at your feet God would that I were grave.<br>

I have now no leisure more to say:<br>

Have mercy, sweet, or you will *do me dey."*           *cause me to die*<br>
</p>

<p id="id01210">She gan to look upon Aurelius;<br>

"Is this your will," quoth she, "and say ye thus?<br>

Ne'er erst,"* quoth she, "I wiste what ye meant:                 *before<br>

But now, Aurelius, I know your intent.<br>

By thilke* God that gave me soul and life,                         *that<br>

Never shall I be an untrue wife<br>

In word nor work, as far as I have wit;<br>

I will be his to whom that I am knit;<br>

Take this for final answer as of me."<br>

But after that *in play* thus saide she.            *playfully, in jest*<br>

"Aurelius," quoth she, "by high God above,<br>

Yet will I grante you to be your love<br>

(Since I you see so piteously complain);<br>

Looke, what day that endelong* Bretagne              *from end to end of<br>

Ye remove all the rockes, stone by stone,<br>

That they not lette* ship nor boat to gon,                      *prevent<br>

I say, when ye have made this coast so clean<br>

Of rockes, that there is no stone seen,<br>

Then will I love you best of any man;<br>

Have here my troth, in all that ever I can;<br>

For well I wot that it shall ne'er betide.<br>

Let such folly out of your hearte glide.<br>

What dainty* should a man have in his life              *value, pleasure<br>

For to go love another manne's wife,<br>

That hath her body when that ever him liketh?"<br>

Aurelius full often sore siketh;*                               *sigheth<br>

Is there none other grace in you?" quoth he,<br>

"No, by that Lord," quoth she, "that maked me.<br>

Woe was Aurelius when that he this heard,<br>

And with a sorrowful heart he thus answer'd.<br>

"Madame, quoth he, "this were an impossible.<br>

Then must I die of sudden death horrible."<br>

And with that word he turned him anon.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01211">Then came her other friends many a one,<br>

And in the alleys roamed up and down,<br>

And nothing wist of this conclusion,<br>

But suddenly began to revel new,<br>

Till that the brighte sun had lost his hue,<br>

For th' horizon had reft the sun his light<br>

(This is as much to say as it was night);<br>

And home they go in mirth and in solace;<br>

Save only wretch'd Aurelius, alas<br>

He to his house is gone with sorrowful heart.<br>

He said, he may not from his death astart.*                      *escape<br>

Him seemed, that he felt his hearte cold.<br>

Up to the heav'n his handes gan he hold,<br>

And on his knees bare he set him down.<br>

And in his raving said his orisoun.*                             *prayer<br>

For very woe out of his wit he braid;*                         *wandered<br>

He wist not what he spake, but thus he said;<br>

With piteous heart his plaint hath he begun<br>

Unto the gods, and first unto the Sun.<br>

He said; "Apollo God and governour<br>

Of every plante, herbe, tree, and flower,<br>

That giv'st, after thy declination,<br>

To each of them his time and his season,<br>

As thine herberow* changeth low and high;           *dwelling, situation<br>

Lord Phoebus: cast thy merciable eye<br>

On wretched Aurelius, which that am but lorn.*                   *undone<br>

Lo, lord, my lady hath my death y-sworn,<br>

Withoute guilt, but* thy benignity                               *unless<br>

Upon my deadly heart have some pity.<br>

For well I wot, Lord Phoebus, if you lest,*                      *please<br>

Ye may me helpe, save my lady, best.<br>

Now vouchsafe, that I may you devise*                     *tell, explain<br>

How that I may be holp,* and in what wise.                       *helped<br>

Your blissful sister, Lucina the sheen, &lt;9&gt;<br>

That of the sea is chief goddess and queen, —<br>

Though Neptunus have deity in the sea,<br>

Yet emperess above him is she;  —<br>

Ye know well, lord, that, right as her desire<br>

Is to be quick'd* and lighted of your fire,                   *quickened<br>

For which she followeth you full busily,<br>

Right so the sea desireth naturally<br>

To follow her, as she that is goddess<br>

Both in the sea and rivers more and less.<br>

Wherefore, Lord Phoebus, this is my request,<br>

Do this miracle, or *do mine hearte brest;*              *cause my heart<br>

That flow, next at this opposition,                            to burst*<br>

Which in the sign shall be of the Lion,<br>

As praye her so great a flood to bring,<br>

That five fathom at least it overspring<br>

The highest rock in Armoric Bretagne,<br>

And let this flood endure yeares twain:<br>

Then certes to my lady may I say,<br>

"Holde your hest," the rockes be away.<br>

Lord Phoebus, this miracle do for me,<br>

Pray her she go no faster course than ye;<br>

I say this, pray your sister that she go<br>

No faster course than ye these yeares two:<br>

Then shall she be even at full alway,<br>

And spring-flood laste bothe night and day.<br>

And *but she* vouchesafe in such mannere                 *if she do not*<br>

To grante me my sov'reign lady dear,<br>

Pray her to sink every rock adown<br>

Into her owen darke regioun<br>

Under the ground, where Pluto dwelleth in<br>

Or nevermore shall I my lady win.<br>

Thy temple in Delphos will I barefoot seek.<br>

Lord Phoebus! see the teares on my cheek<br>

And on my pain have some compassioun."<br>

And with that word in sorrow he fell down,<br>

And longe time he lay forth in a trance.<br>

His brother, which that knew of his penance,*                  *distress<br>

Up caught him, and to bed he hath him brought,<br>

Despaired in this torment and this thought<br>

Let I this woeful creature lie;<br>

Choose he for me whe'er* he will live or die.                   *whether<br>

<p id="id01212">Arviragus with health and great honour<br>

(As he that was of chivalry the flow'r)<br>

Is come home, and other worthy men.<br>

Oh, blissful art thou now, thou Dorigen!<br>

Thou hast thy lusty husband in thine arms,<br>

The freshe knight, the worthy man of arms,<br>

That loveth thee as his own hearte's life:<br>

*Nothing list him to be imaginatif*              *he cared not to fancy*<br>

If any wight had spoke, while he was out,<br>

To her of love; he had of that no doubt;*               *fear, suspicion<br>

He not intended* to no such mattere,              *occupied himself with<br>

But danced, jousted, and made merry cheer.<br>

And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell,<br>

And of the sick Aurelius will I tell<br>

In languor and in torment furious<br>

Two year and more lay wretch'd Aurelius,<br>

Ere any foot on earth he mighte gon;<br>

Nor comfort in this time had he none,<br>

Save of his brother, which that was a clerk.*                   *scholar<br>

He knew of all this woe and all this work;<br>

For to none other creature certain<br>

Of this matter he durst no worde sayn;<br>

Under his breast he bare it more secree<br>

Than e'er did Pamphilus for Galatee.&lt;10&gt;<br>

His breast was whole withoute for to seen,<br>

But in his heart aye was the arrow keen,<br>

And well ye know that of a sursanure &lt;11&gt;<br>

In surgery is perilous the cure,<br>

But* men might touch the arrow or come thereby.                  *except<br>

His brother wept and wailed privily,<br>

Till at the last him fell in remembrance,<br>

That while he was at Orleans &lt;12&gt; in France, —<br>

As younge clerkes, that be likerous* —                           *eager<br>

To readen artes that be curious,<br>

Seeken in every *halk and every hern*             *nook and corner* &lt;13&gt;<br>

Particular sciences for to learn,—<br>

He him remember'd, that upon a day<br>

At Orleans in study a book he say*                                  *saw<br>

Of magic natural, which his fellaw,<br>

That was that time a bachelor of law<br>

All* were he there to learn another craft,                       *though<br>

Had privily upon his desk y-laft;<br>

Which book spake much of operations<br>

Touching the eight and-twenty mansions<br>

That longe to the Moon, and such folly<br>

As in our dayes is not worth a fly;<br>

For holy church's faith, in our believe,*                 *belief, creed<br>

Us suff'reth none illusion to grieve.<br>

And when this book was in his remembrance<br>

Anon for joy his heart began to dance,<br>

And to himself he saide privily;<br>

"My brother shall be warish'd* hastily                            *cured<br>

For I am sicker* that there be sciences,                        *certain<br>

By which men make divers apparences,<br>

Such as these subtle tregetoures play.                  *tricksters &lt;14&gt;<br>

For oft at feaste's have I well heard say,<br>

That tregetours, within a halle large,<br>

Have made come in a water and a barge,<br>

And in the halle rowen up and down.<br>

Sometimes hath seemed come a grim lioun,<br>

And sometimes flowers spring as in a mead;<br>

Sometimes a vine, and grapes white and red;<br>

Sometimes a castle all of lime and stone;<br>

And, when them liked, voided* it anon:                         *vanished<br>

Thus seemed it to every manne's sight.<br>

Now then conclude I thus; if that I might<br>

At Orleans some olde fellow find,<br>

That hath these Moone's mansions in mind,<br>

Or other magic natural above.<br>

He should well make my brother have his love.<br>

For with an appearance a clerk* may make,                   *learned man<br>

To manne's sight, that all the rockes blake<br>

Of Bretagne were voided* every one,                             *removed<br>

And shippes by the brinke come and gon,<br>

And in such form endure a day or two;<br>

Then were my brother warish'd* of his woe,                        *cured<br>

Then must she needes *holde her behest,*              *keep her promise*<br>

Or elles he shall shame her at the least."<br>

Why should I make a longer tale of this?<br>

Unto his brother's bed he comen is,<br>

And such comfort he gave him, for to gon<br>

To Orleans, that he upstart anon,<br>

And on his way forth-ward then is he fare,*                        *gone<br>

Which that in Latin *thriftily them gret.*                 *greeted them<br>

I know," quoth he, "the cause of your coming;"<br>

Aud ere they farther any foote went,<br>

He told them all that was in their intent.<br>

The Breton clerk him asked of fellaws<br>

The which he hadde known in olde daws,*                            *days<br>

And he answer'd him that they deade were,<br>

For which he wept full often many a tear.<br>

Down off his horse Aurelius light anon,<br>

And forth with this magician is be gone<br>

Home to his house, and made him well at ease;<br>

So well-array'd a house as there was one,<br>

Aurelius in his life saw never none.<br>

He shewed him, ere they went to suppere,<br>

Forestes, parkes, full of wilde deer.<br>

There saw he hartes with their hornes high,<br>

The greatest that were ever seen with eye.<br>

He saw of them an hundred slain with hounds,<br>

And some with arrows bleed of bitter wounds.<br>

He saw, when voided* were the wilde deer,                   *passed away<br>

These falconers upon a fair rivere,<br>

That with their hawkes have the heron slain.<br>

Then saw he knightes jousting in a plain.<br>

And after this he did him such pleasance,<br>

That he him shew'd his lady on a dance,<br>

In which himselfe danced, as him thought.<br>

And when this master, that this magic wrought,<br>

Saw it was time, he clapp'd his handes two,<br>

And farewell, all the revel is y-go.*                     *gone, removed<br>

And yet remov'd they never out of the house,<br>

While they saw all the sightes marvellous;<br>

But in his study, where his bookes be,<br>

They satte still, and no wight but they three.<br>

To him this master called his squier,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01214">And said him thus, "May we go to supper?<br>

Almost an hour it is, I undertake,<br>

It is all ready, though ye will right now."<br>

"Go we then sup," quoth he, "as for the best;<br>

At after supper fell they in treaty<br>

Answered thus; "Fie on a thousand pound!<br>

This wide world, which that men say is round,<br>

I would it give, if I were lord of it.<br>

This bargain is full-driv'n, for we be knit;*                    *agreed<br>

Ye shall be payed truly by my troth.<br>

To bed is gone Aurelius when him lest,                      faith on it*<br>

And well-nigh all that night he had his rest,<br>

What for his labour, and his hope of bliss,<br>

His woeful heart *of penance had a liss.*                 *had a respite<br>

                                                         from suffering*<br>

Upon the morrow, when that it was day,<br>

Unto Bretagne they took the righte way,<br>

Aurelius and this magician beside,<br>

And be descended where they would abide:<br>

And this was, as the bookes me remember,<br>

The colde frosty season of December.<br>

Phoebus wax'd old, and hued like latoun,*                         *brass<br>

That in his hote declinatioun<br>

Shone as the burned gold, with streames* bright;                  *beams<br>

But now in Capricorn adown he light,<br>

Where as he shone full pale, I dare well sayn.<br>

The bitter frostes, with the sleet and rain,<br>

Destroyed have the green in every yard.               *courtyard, garden<br>

Janus sits by the fire with double beard,<br>

And drinketh of his bugle horn the wine:<br>

Before him stands the brawn of tusked swine<br>

And "nowel"* crieth every lusty man                           *Noel &lt;18&gt;<br>

Aurelius, in all that ev'r he can,<br>

Did to his master cheer and reverence,<br>

And prayed him to do his diligence<br>

To bringe him out of his paines smart,<br>

Or with a sword that he would slit his heart.<br>

This subtle clerk such ruth* had on this man,                      *pity<br>

That night and day he sped him, that he can,<br>

To wait a time of his conclusion;<br>

This is to say, to make illusion,<br>

By such an appearance of jugglery<br>

(I know no termes of astrology),<br>

That she and every wight should ween and say,<br>

That of Bretagne the rockes were away,<br>

Or else they were sunken under ground.<br>

So at the last he hath a time found<br>

To make his japes* and his wretchedness                          *tricks<br>

Of such a *superstitious cursedness.*              *detestable villainy*<br>

His tables Toletanes &lt;19&gt; forth he brought,<br>

Full well corrected, that there lacked nought,<br>

Neither his collect, nor his expanse years,<br>

Neither his rootes, nor his other gears,<br>

As be his centres, and his arguments,<br>

And his proportional convenients<br>

For his equations in everything.<br>

And by his eighte spheres in his working,<br>

He knew full well how far Alnath &lt;20&gt; was shove<br>

From the head of that fix'd Aries above,<br>

That in the ninthe sphere consider'd is.<br>

Full subtilly he calcul'd all this.<br>

When he had found his firste mansion,<br>

He knew the remnant by proportion;<br>

And knew the rising of his moone well,<br>

And in whose face, and term, and every deal;<br>

And knew full well the moone's mansion<br>

Accordant to his operation;<br>

And knew also his other observances,<br>

For such illusions and such meschances,*                 *wicked devices<br>

As heathen folk used in thilke days.<br>

For which no longer made he delays;<br>

But through his magic, for a day or tway, &lt;21&gt;<br>

It seemed all the rockes were away.<br>

Hath there not many a noble wife, ere this,                my exemption*<br>

And many a maiden, slain herself, alas!<br>

Rather than with her body do trespass?<br>

Yes, certes; lo, these stories bear witness. &lt;22&gt;<br>

When thirty tyrants full of cursedness*                      *wickedness<br>

Had slain Phidon in Athens at the feast,<br>

They commanded his daughters to arrest,<br>

And bringe them before them, in despite,<br>

All naked, to fulfil their foul delight;<br>

And in their father's blood they made them dance<br>

Upon the pavement, — God give them mischance.<br>

For which these woeful maidens, full of dread,<br>

Rather than they would lose their maidenhead,<br>

They privily *be start* into a well,                    *suddenly leaped<br>

And drowned themselves, as the bookes tell.<br>

They of Messene let inquire and seek<br>

Of Lacedaemon fifty maidens eke,<br>

On which they woulde do their lechery:<br>

But there was none of all that company<br>

That was not slain, and with a glad intent<br>

Chose rather for to die, than to assent<br>

To be oppressed* of her maidenhead.                     *forcibly bereft<br>

Why should I then to dien be in dread?<br>

Lo, eke the tyrant Aristoclides,<br>

That lov'd a maiden hight Stimphalides,<br>

When that her father slain was on a night,<br>

Unto Diana's temple went she right,<br>

And hent* the image in her handes two,                  *caught, clasped<br>

From which image she woulde never go;<br>

No wight her handes might off it arace,*            *pluck away by force<br>

Till she was slain right in the selfe* place.                      *same<br>

Now since that maidens hadde such despite<br>

To be defouled with man's foul delight,<br>

Well ought a wife rather herself to sle,*                          *slay<br>

Than be defouled, as it thinketh me.<br>

What shall I say of Hasdrubale's wife,<br>

That at Carthage bereft herself of life?<br>

For, when she saw the Romans win the town,<br>

She took her children all, and skipt adown<br>

Into the fire, and rather chose to die,<br>

Than any Roman did her villainy.<br>

Hath not Lucretia slain herself, alas!<br>

At Rome, when that she oppressed* was                          *ravished<br>

Of Tarquin? for her thought it was a shame<br>

To live, when she hadde lost her name.<br>

The seven maidens of Milesie also<br>

Have slain themselves for very dread and woe,<br>

Rather than folk of Gaul them should oppress.<br>

More than a thousand stories, as I guess,<br>

Could I now tell as touching this mattere.<br>

When Abradate was slain, his wife so dear &lt;23&gt;<br>

Herselfe slew, and let her blood to glide<br>

In Abradate's woundes, deep and wide,<br>

And said, 'My body at the leaste way<br>

There shall no wight defoul, if that I may.'<br>

Why should I more examples hereof sayn?<br>

Since that so many have themselves slain,<br>

Well rather than they would defouled be,<br>

I will conclude that it is bet* for me                           *better<br>

To slay myself, than be defouled thus.<br>

I will be true unto Arviragus,<br>

Or elles slay myself in some mannere,<br>

As did Demotione's daughter dear,<br>

Because she woulde not defouled be.<br>

O Sedasus, it is full great pity<br>

To reade how thy daughters died, alas!<br>

That slew themselves *for suche manner cas.*        *in circumstances of<br>

As great a pity was it, or well more,                     the same kind*<br>

The Theban maiden, that for Nicanor<br>

Herselfe slew, right for such manner woe.<br>

Another Theban maiden did right so;<br>

For one of Macedon had her oppress'd,<br>

She with her death her maidenhead redress'd.*                *vindicated<br>

What shall I say of Niceratus' wife,<br>

That for such case bereft herself her life?<br>

How true was eke to Alcibiades<br>

His love, that for to dien rather chese,*                         *chose<br>

Than for to suffer his body unburied be?<br>

Lo, what a wife was Alceste?" quoth she.<br>

"What saith Homer of good Penelope?<br>

All Greece knoweth of her chastity.<br>

Pardie, of Laedamia is written thus,<br>

That when at Troy was slain Protesilaus, &lt;24&gt;<br>

No longer would she live after his day.<br>

The same of noble Porcia tell I may;<br>

Withoute Brutus coulde she not live,<br>

To whom she did all whole her hearte give. &lt;25&gt;<br>

The perfect wifehood of Artemisie &lt;26&gt;<br>

    As in my guilt, were either war or strife"
Would to God there may never be war or strife between us,

<p id="id01226">3. Perhaps the true reading is "beteth" — prepares, makes ready,
his wings for flight.</p>

<p id="id01227">4. Penmark: On the west coast of Brittany, between Brest and
L'Orient.  The name is composed of two British words, "pen,"
mountain, and "mark," region; it therefore means the
mountainous country</p>

<p id="id01228">5. Cairrud: "The red city;" it is not known where it was
situated.</p>

<p id="id01229">6. Warished: cured; French, "guerir," to heal, or recover from
sickness.</p>

<p id="id01230">7. Annoyeth: works mischief; from Latin, "nocco," I hurt.</p>

<p id="id01231">8. Virelays:  ballads; the "virelai" was an ancient French poem
of two rhymes.</p>

<p id="id01232">9. Lucina the sheen:  Diana the bright. See note 54 to the
Knight's Tale.</p>

relates his amour with Galatea, setting out with the idea
adopted by our poet in the lines that follow.</p>

<p id="id01234">11. Sursanure:  A wound healed on the surface, but festering
beneath.</p>

<p id="id01235">12. Orleans:  Where there was a celebrated and very famous
university, afterwards eclipsed by that of Paris.  It was founded
by Philip le Bel in 1312.</p>

<p id="id01236">13. Every  halk and every hern: Every nook and corner, Anglo-
Saxon, "healc," a nook; "hyrn," a corner.</p>

<p id="id01237">14. Tregetoures: tricksters, jugglers. The word is probably
derived — in "treget," deceit or imposture — from the French
"trebuchet," a military machine; since it is evident that much and
elaborate machinery must have been employed to produce the
effects afterwards described. Another derivation is from the
Low Latin, "tricator," a deceiver.</p>

<p id="id01245">22. These stories are all taken from the book of St Jerome
"Contra Jovinianum," from which the Wife of Bath drew so
many of her ancient instances. See note 1 to the prologue to the
Wife of Bath's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01246">23. Panthea.  Abradatas, King of Susa, was an ally of the
Assyrians against Cyrus; and his wife was taken at the conquest
of the Assyrian camp.  Struck by the honourable treatment she
received at the captors hands, Abradatas joined Cyrus, and fell
in battle against his former alhes.  His wife, inconsolable at his
loss, slew herself immediately.</p>

<p id="id01247">24. Protesilaus was the husband of Laedamia.  She begged the
gods, after his death, that but three hours' converse with him

dead husband, at the expiry of the time, returned to the world of
shades, she bore him company.</p>

made war on and was conquered by the Romans, B.C 228.</p>

<p id="id01252">29. Bound:  prepared; going. To "boun" or "bown" is a good

<p id="id01259" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Doctor's Tale</p>

<p id="id01260" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The authenticity of the prologue is questionable. It is found in
one manuscript only; other manuscripts give other prologues,
more plainly not Chaucer's than this; and some manuscripts
have merely a colophon to the effect that "Here endeth the
Franklin's Tale and beginneth the Physician's Tale without a
prologue." The Tale itself is the well-known story of Virginia,
with several departures from the text of Livy. Chaucer probably
followed the "Romance of the Rose" and Gower's "Confessio
Amantis," in both of which the story is found.</p>

<h4 id="id01261" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE.</h4>

<p id="id01262" style="margin-top: 2em">There was, as telleth Titus Livius, &lt;1&gt;<br>

A knight, that called was Virginius,<br>

Full filled of honour and worthiness,<br>

And strong of friendes, and of great richess.<br>

This knight one daughter hadde by his wife;<br>

No children had he more in all his life.<br>

Fair was this maid in excellent beauty<br>

Aboven ev'ry wight that man may see:<br>

For nature had with sov'reign diligence<br>

Y-formed her in so great excellence,<br>

As though she woulde say, "Lo, I, Nature,<br>

Thus can I form and paint a creature,<br>

When that me list; who can me counterfeit?<br>

Pygmalion? not though he aye forge and beat,<br>

Or grave or painte: for I dare well sayn,<br>

Apelles, Zeuxis, shoulde work in vain,<br>

Either to grave, or paint, or forge, or beat,<br>

If they presumed me to counterfeit.<br>

For he that is the former principal,<br>

Hath made me his vicar-general<br>

To form and painten earthly creatures<br>

Right as me list, and all thing in my cure* is,                    *care<br>

Under the moone, that may wane and wax.<br>

And for my work right nothing will I ax*                            *ask<br>

My lord and I be full of one accord.<br>

I made her to the worship* of my lord;<br>

So do I all mine other creatures,<br>

What colour that they have, or what figures."<br>

Thus seemeth me that Nature woulde say.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01263">This maiden was of age twelve year and tway,*                       *two<br>

In which that Nature hadde such delight.<br>

For right as she can paint a lily white,<br>

And red a rose, right with such painture<br>

She painted had this noble creature,<br>

Ere she was born, upon her limbes free,<br>

Where as by right such colours shoulde be:<br>

And Phoebus dyed had her tresses great,<br>

Like to the streames* of his burned heat.                   *beams, rays<br>

And if that excellent was her beauty,<br>

A thousand-fold more virtuous was she.<br>

In her there lacked no condition,<br>

That is to praise, as by discretion.<br>

As well in ghost* as body chaste was she:                  *mind, spirit<br>

For which she flower'd in virginity,<br>

With all humility and abstinence,<br>

With alle temperance and patience,<br>

With measure* eke of bearing and array.                      *moderation<br>

Discreet she was in answering alway,<br>

Though she were wise as Pallas, dare I sayn;<br>

Her faconde* eke full womanly and plain,                     *speech &lt;2&gt;<br>

No counterfeited termes hadde she<br>

To seeme wise; but after her degree<br>

She spake, and all her worde's more and less<br>

Sounding in virtue and in gentleness.<br>

Shamefast she was in maiden's shamefastness,<br>

Constant in heart, and ever *in business*              *diligent, eager*<br>

To drive her out of idle sluggardy:<br>

Bacchus had of her mouth right no mast'ry.<br>

For wine and slothe &lt;3&gt; do Venus increase,<br>

As men in fire will casten oil and grease.<br>

And of her owen virtue, unconstrain'd,<br>

She had herself full often sick y-feign'd,<br>

For that she woulde flee the company,<br>

Where likely was to treaten of folly,<br>

As is at feasts, at revels, and at dances,<br>

That be occasions of dalliances.<br>

Such thinges make children for to be<br>

Too soone ripe and bold, as men may see,<br>

Which is full perilous, and hath been yore;*                     *of old<br>

For all too soone may she learne lore<br>

Of boldeness, when that she is a wife.<br>

<p id="id01264">And ye mistresses,* in your olde life              *governesses, duennas<br>

Take not of my wordes displeasance<br>

Thinke that ye be set in governings<br>

Of lordes' daughters only for two things;<br>

Either for ye have kept your honesty,<br>

Or else for ye have fallen in frailty<br>

And knowe well enough the olde dance,<br>

And have forsaken fully such meschance*                  *wickedness &lt;4&gt;<br>

Can keep a forest best of any man;<br>

Now keep them well, for if ye will ye can.<br>

Look well, that ye unto no vice assent,<br>

Lest ye be damned for your wick'*  intent,                 *wicked, evil<br>

For whoso doth, a traitor is certain;<br>

And take keep* of that I shall you sayn;                           *heed<br>

Of alle treason, sov'reign pestilence<br>

Is when a wight betrayeth innocence.<br>

Ye fathers, and ye mothers eke also,<br>

Though ye have children, be it one or mo',<br>

Yours is the charge of all their surveyance,*               *supervision<br>

While that they be under your governance.<br>

Beware, that by example of your living,<br>

Or by your negligence in chastising,<br>

That they not perish for I dare well say,<br>

If that they do, ye shall it dear abeye.*           *pay for, suffer for<br>

Under a shepherd soft and negligent<br>

The wolf hath many a sheep and lamb to-rent.<br>

Suffice this example now as here,<br>

For I must turn again to my mattere.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01265">This maid, of which I tell my tale express,<br>

She kept herself, her needed no mistress;<br>

For in her living maidens mighte read,<br>

As in a book, ev'ry good word and deed<br>

That longeth to a maiden virtuous;<br>

She was so prudent and so bounteous.<br>

For which the fame out sprang on every side<br>

Both of her beauty and her bounte* wide:                       *goodness<br>

That through the land they praised her each one<br>

That loved virtue, save envy alone,<br>

That sorry is of other manne's weal,<br>

And glad is of his sorrow and unheal* —                     *misfortune<br>

The Doctor maketh this descriptioun. — &lt;5&gt;<br>

This maiden on a day went in the town<br>

Toward a temple, with her mother dear,<br>

As is of younge maidens the mannere.<br>

Now was there then a justice in that town,<br>

That governor was of that regioun:<br>

And so befell, this judge his eyen cast<br>

Upon this maid, avising* her full fast,                       *observing<br>

As she came forth by where this judge stood;<br>

Anon his hearte changed and his mood,<br>

So was he caught with beauty of this maid<br>

And to himself full privily he said,<br>

"This maiden shall be mine *for any man."*             *despite what any<br>

Anon the fiend into his hearte ran,                          man may do*<br>

And taught him suddenly, that he by sleight<br>

This maiden to his purpose winne might.<br>

For certes, by no force, nor by no meed,*                 *bribe, reward<br>

Him thought he was not able for to speed;<br>

For she was strong of friendes, and eke she<br>

Confirmed was in such sov'reign bounte,<br>

That well he wist he might her never win,<br>

As for to make her with her body sin.<br>

For which, with great deliberatioun,<br>

He sent after a clerk &lt;6&gt;  was in the town,<br>

The which he knew for subtle and for bold.<br>

This judge unto this clerk his tale told<br>

In secret wise, and made him to assure<br>

He shoulde tell it to no creature,<br>

And if he did, he shoulde lose his head.<br>

And when assented was this cursed rede,*                  *counsel, plot<br>

Glad was the judge, and made him greate cheer,<br>

And gave him giftes precious and dear.<br>

When shapen* was all their conspiracy                          *arranged<br>

From point to point, how that his lechery<br>

Performed shoulde be full subtilly,<br>

As ye shall hear it after openly,<br>

Home went this clerk, that highte Claudius.<br>

This false judge, that highte Appius, —<br>

(So was his name, for it is no fable,<br>

But knowen for a storial*  thing notable;         *historical, authentic<br>

The sentence* of it sooth** is out of doubt); —         *account **true<br>

This false judge went now fast about<br>

To hasten his delight all that he may.<br>

And so befell, soon after on a day,<br>

This false judge, as telleth us the story,<br>

As he was wont, sat in his consistory,<br>

And gave his doomes* upon sundry case';                       *judgments<br>

This false clerk came forth *a full great pace,*               *in haste<br>

And saide; Lord, if that it be your will,<br>

As do me right upon this piteous bill,*                        *petition<br>

In which I plain upon Virginius.<br>

And if that he will say it is not thus,<br>

I will it prove, and finde good witness,<br>

That sooth is what my bille will express."<br>

The judge answer'd, "Of this, in his absence,<br>

I may not give definitive sentence.<br>

Let do* him call, and I will gladly hear;                         *cause<br>

Thou shalt have alle right, and no wrong here."<br>

Virginius came to weet* the judge's will,                   *know, learn<br>

And right anon was read this cursed bill;<br>

The sentence of it was as ye shall hear<br>

"To you, my lord, Sir Appius so clear,<br>

Sheweth your poore servant Claudius,<br>

How that a knight called Virginius,<br>

Against the law, against all equity,<br>

Holdeth, express against the will of me,<br>

My servant, which that is my thrall* by right,                    *slave<br>

Which from my house was stolen on a night,<br>

While that she was full young; I will it preve*                   *prove<br>

By witness, lord, so that it you *not grieve;*      *be not displeasing*<br>

She is his daughter not, what so he say.<br>

Wherefore to you, my lord the judge, I pray,<br>

Yield me my thrall, if that it be your will."<br>

Lo, this was all the sentence of the bill.<br>

Virginius gan upon the clerk behold;<br>

But hastily, ere he his tale told,<br>

And would have proved it, as should a knight,<br>

And eke by witnessing of many a wight,<br>

That all was false that said his adversary,<br>

This cursed judge would no longer tarry,<br>

Nor hear a word more of Virginius,<br>

But gave his judgement, and saide thus:<br>

"I deem* anon this clerk his servant have;         *pronounce, determine<br>

Thou shalt no longer in thy house her save.<br>

Go, bring her forth, and put her in our ward<br>

The clerk shall have his thrall: thus I award."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01266">And when this worthy knight, Virginius,<br>

Through sentence of this justice Appius,<br>

Muste by force his deare daughter give<br>

Unto the judge, in lechery to live,<br>

He went him home, and sat him in his hall,<br>

And let anon his deare daughter call;<br>

And with a face dead as ashes cold<br>

Upon her humble face he gan behold,<br>

With father's pity sticking* through his heart,                *piercing<br>

All* would he from his purpose not convert.**     *although **turn aside<br>

"Daughter," quoth he, "Virginia by name,<br>

There be two wayes, either death or shame,<br>

That thou must suffer, — alas that I was bore!*                   *born<br>

For never thou deservedest wherefore<br>

To dien with a sword or with a knife,<br>

O deare daughter, ender of my life,<br>

Whom I have foster'd up with such pleasance<br>

That thou were ne'er out of my remembrance;<br>

O daughter, which that art my laste woe,<br>

And in this life my laste joy also,<br>

O gem of chastity, in patience<br>

Take thou thy death, for this is my sentence:<br>

For love and not for hate thou must be dead;<br>

My piteous hand must smiten off thine head.<br>

Alas, that ever Appius thee say!*                                   *saw<br>

Thus hath he falsely judged thee to-day."<br>

And told her all the case, as ye before<br>

Have heard; it needeth not to tell it more.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01267">"O mercy, deare father," quoth the maid.<br>

And with that word she both her armes laid<br>

About his neck, as she was wont to do,<br>

(The teares burst out of her eyen two),<br>

And said, "O goode father, shall I die?<br>

Is there no grace? is there no remedy?"<br>

"No, certes, deare daughter mine," quoth he.<br>

"Then give me leisure, father mine, quoth she,<br>

"My death for to complain* a little space                        *bewail<br>

For, pardie, Jephthah gave his daughter grace<br>

For to complain, ere he her slew, alas! &lt;7&gt;<br>

And, God it wot, nothing was her trespass,*                     *offence<br>

But for she ran her father first to see,<br>

To welcome him with great solemnity."<br>

And with that word she fell a-swoon anon;<br>

And after, when her swooning was y-gone,<br>

She rose up, and unto her father said:<br>

"Blessed be God, that I shall die a maid.<br>

Give me my death, ere that I have shame;<br>

Do with your child your will, in Godde's name."<br>

And with that word she prayed him full oft<br>

I paine me to have an hautein* speech,            *take pains **loud &lt;2&gt;<br>

And ring it out, as round as doth a bell,<br>

For I know all by rote that I tell.<br>

My theme is always one, and ever was;<br>

Radix malorum est cupiditas.&lt;3&gt;<br>

First I pronounce whence that I come,<br>

And then my bulles shew I all and some;<br>

Our liege lorde's seal on my patent,<br>

That shew I first, *my body to warrent,*             *for the protection<br>

That no man be so hardy, priest nor clerk,                 of my person*<br>

Me to disturb of Christe's holy werk.<br>

And after that then tell I forth my tales.<br>

Bulles of popes, and of cardinales,<br>

Of patriarchs, and of bishops I shew,<br>

And in Latin I speak a wordes few,<br>

To savour with my predication,<br>

And for to stir men to devotion<br>

Then show I forth my longe crystal stones,<br>

Y-crammed fall of cloutes* and of bones;                *rags, fragments<br>

Relics they be, as *weene they* each one.        *as my listeners think*<br>

Then have I in latoun* a shoulder-bone                            *brass<br>

Which that was of a holy Jewe's sheep.<br>

"Good men," say I, "take of my wordes keep;*                       *heed<br>

If that this bone be wash'd in any well,<br>

If cow, or calf, or sheep, or oxe swell,<br>

As thilke holy Jew our elders taught,<br>

His beastes and his store shall multiply.<br>

And, Sirs, also it healeth jealousy;<br>

For though a man be fall'n in jealous rage,<br>

Let make with this water his pottage,<br>

To offer to my relics in this place.<br>

And whoso findeth him out of such blame,<br>

And when the lewed* people down is set,                        *ignorant<br>

I preache so as ye have heard before,<br>

And telle them a hundred japes* more.                    *jests, deceits<br>

Then pain I me to stretche forth my neck,<br>

And east and west upon the people I beck,<br>

As doth a dove, sitting on a bern;*                                *barn<br>

That it is joy to see my business.<br>

Of avarice and of such cursedness*                           *wickedness<br>

Is all my preaching, for to make them free<br>

To give their pence, and namely* unto me.                    *especially<br>

For mine intent is not but for to win,<br>

And nothing for correction of sin.<br>

I recke never, when that they be buried,<br>

Though that their soules go a blackburied.&lt;5&gt;<br>

For certes *many a predication              *preaching is often inspired<br>

Cometh oft-time of evil intention;*                     by evil motives*<br>

Some for pleasance of folk, and flattery,<br>

To be advanced by hypocrisy;<br>

And some for vainglory, and some for hate.<br>

For, when I dare not otherwise debate,<br>

Then will I sting him with my tongue smart*                     *sharply<br>

In preaching, so that he shall not astart*                       *escape<br>

To be defamed falsely, if that he<br>

Hath trespass'd* to my brethren or to me.                      *offended<br>

For, though I telle not his proper name,<br>

Men shall well knowe that it is the same<br>

By signes, and by other circumstances.<br>

Thus *quite I* folk that do us displeasances:         *I am revenged on*<br>

Thus spit I out my venom, under hue<br>

Of holiness, to seem holy and true.<br>

But, shortly mine intent I will devise,<br>

I preach of nothing but of covetise.<br>

Therefore my theme is yet, and ever was, —<br>

Radix malorum est cupiditas. &lt;3&gt;<br>

Thus can I preach against the same vice<br>

Which that I use, and that is avarice.<br>

But though myself be guilty in that sin,<br>

Yet can I maken other folk to twin*                              *depart<br>

From avarice, and sore them repent.<br>

But that is not my principal intent;<br>

I preache nothing but for covetise.<br>

Of this mattere it ought enough suffice.<br>

Then tell I them examples many a one,<br>

Of olde stories longe time gone;<br>

For lewed* people love tales old;                             *unlearned<br>

Such thinges can they well report and hold.<br>

What? trowe ye, that whiles I may preach<br>

And winne gold and silver for* I teach,                         *because<br>

That I will live in povert' wilfully?<br>

Nay, nay, I thought it never truely.<br>

For I will preach and beg in sundry lands;<br>

I will not do no labour with mine hands,<br>

Nor make baskets for to live thereby,<br>

Because I will not beggen idlely.<br>

I will none of the apostles counterfeit;*          *imitate (in poverty)<br>

I will have money, wool, and cheese, and wheat,<br>

All* were it given of the poorest page,                         *even if<br>

Or of the pooreste widow in a village:<br>

All should her children sterve* for famine.                         *die<br>

Nay, I will drink the liquor of the vine,<br>

And have a jolly wench in every town.<br>

But hearken, lordings, in conclusioun;<br>

Your liking is, that I shall tell a tale<br>

Now I have drunk a draught of corny ale,<br>

By God, I hope I shall you tell a thing<br>

That shall by reason be to your liking;<br>

For though myself be a full vicious man,<br>

A moral tale yet I you telle can,<br>

Which I am wont to preache, for to win.<br>

Now hold your peace, my tale I will begin.<br>

Witness on Matthew: &lt;22&gt; but in special<br>

Of swearing saith the holy Jeremie, &lt;23&gt;<br>

Thou thalt swear sooth thine oathes, and not lie:<br>

And swear in doom* and eke in righteousness;                  *judgement<br>

How that the second best of him is this,<br>

Take not my name in idle* or amiss.                             *in vain<br>

That of his oathes is outrageous.<br>

God save you, that bought again mankind,<br>

And you amend!" Thus said this olde man;<br>

And evereach of these riotoures ran,<br>

Till they came to the tree, and there they found<br>

Of florins fine, of gold y-coined round,<br>

Well nigh a seven bushels, as them thought.<br>

No longer as then after Death they sought;<br>

But each of them so glad was of the sight,<br>

For that the florins were so fair and bright,<br>

That down they sat them by the precious hoard.<br>

The youngest of them spake the firste word:<br>

"Brethren," quoth he, "*take keep* what I shall say;              *heed*<br>

Today that we should have so fair a grace?<br>

But might this gold he carried from this place<br>

Home to my house, or elles unto yours<br>

Then were we in high felicity.<br>

But truely by day it may not be;<br>

Men woulde say that we were thieves strong,<br>

And for our owen treasure do us hong.*                   *have us hanged<br>

Wherefore I rede,* that cut** among us all                *advise **lots<br>

And he that hath the cut, with hearte blithe<br>

And bring us bread and wine full privily:<br>

And two of us shall keepe subtilly<br>

This treasure well: and if he will not tarry,<br>

When it is night, we will this treasure carry,<br>

By one assent, where as us thinketh best."<br>

Then one of them the cut brought in his fist,<br>

And bade them draw, and look where it would fall;<br>

And it fell on the youngest of them all;<br>

And forth toward the town he went anon.<br>

And all so soon as  that he was y-gone,<br>

The one of them spake thus unto the other;<br>

"Thou knowest well that thou art my sworn brother,<br>

And forth he went, no longer would he tarry,<br>

And prayed him that he him woulde sell<br>

<p id="id01309" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Pardoner's Tale</p>

<p id="id01310" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The outline of this Tale is to be found in the "Cento Novelle
Antiche," but the original is now lost. As in the case of the Wife
of Bath's Tale, there is a long prologue, but in this case it has
been treated as part of the Tale.</p>

<p id="id01311">2. Hautein: loud, lofty; from French, "hautain."</p>

<p id="id01312">3. Radix malorum est cupiditas: "the love of money is the root
of all evil" (1 Tim.vi. 10)</p>

<p id="id01313">4.All had she taken priestes two or three: even if she had
committed adultery with two or three priests.</p>

<p id="id01314">5. Blackburied: The meaning of this is not very clear, but it is
probably a periphrastic and picturesque way of indicating
damnation.</p>

<p id="id01315">6. Grisly: dreadful; fitted to "agrise" or horrify the listener.</p>

<p id="id01316">7.  Mr Wright says: "The common oaths in the Middle Ages
were by the different parts of God's body; and the popular
preachers represented that profane swearers tore Christ's body
by their imprecations." The idea was doubtless borrowed from
the passage in Hebrews (vi. 6), where apostates are said to
"crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to
an open shame."</p>

<p id="id01317">8. Tombesteres: female dancers or tumblers; from Anglo-
Saxon, "tumban," to dance.</p>

<p id="id01318">9. "Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess." Eph. v.18.</p>

<p id="id01319">10. The reference is probably to the diligent inquiries Herod
made at the time of Christ's birth. See Matt. ii. 4-8</p>

<p id="id01320">11. A drunkard. "Perhaps," says Tyrwhitt, "Chaucer refers to
Epist. LXXXIII., 'Extende in plures dies illum ebrii habitum;
nunquid de furore dubitabis? nunc quoque non est minor sed
brevior.'"  ("Prolong the drunkard's condition to several days;
will you doubt his madness? Even as it is, the madness is no
less; merely shorter.")</p>

<p id="id01321">12. Defended: forbidden; French, "defendu."  St Jerome, in his
book against Jovinian, says that so long as Adam fasted, he was
in Paradise; he ate, and he was thrust out.</p>

<p id="id01322">13. "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall
destroy both it and them." 1 Cor. vi. 13.</p>

<p id="id01323">14. "For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now
tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of
Christ:  Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and
whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things."  Phil.
iii. 18, 19.</p>

<p id="id01324">15. Cod: bag; Anglo-Saxon, "codde;" hence peas-cod, pin-cod
(pin-cushion), &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id01325">16. Compare with the lines which follow, the picture of the
drunken messenger in the Man of Law's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01326">17. Lepe:  A town near Cadiz, whence a stronger wine than the
Gascon vintages afforded was imported to England. French
wine was often adulterated with the cheaper and stronger
Spanish.</p>

<p id="id01327">18. Another reading is "Fleet Street."</p>

<p id="id01328">19. Attila was suffocated in the night by a haemorrhage,
brought on by a debauch, when he was preparing a new
invasion of Italy, in 453.</p>

<p id="id01329">20. "It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink
wine, nor for princes strong drink; lest they drink, and forget
the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted." Prov.
xxxi. 4, 5.</p>

<p id="id01330">21. Most manuscripts, evidently in error, have "Stilbon" and
"Calidone" for Chilon and Lacedaemon. Chilon was one of the
seven sages of Greece, and flourished about B.C. 590.
According to Diogenes Laertius, he died, under the pressure of
age and joy, in the arms of his son, who had just been crowned
victor at the Olympic games.</p>

<p id="id01331">22. "Swear not at all;" Christ's words in Matt. v. 34.</p>

<p id="id01332">23. "And thou shalt swear, the lord liveth in truth, in judgement,
and in righteousness."  Jeremiah iv. 2</p>

<p id="id01333">24. The nails that fastened Christ on the cross, which were
regarded with superstitious reverence.</p>

<p id="id01334">25. Hailes: An abbey in Gloucestershire, where, under the
designation of "the blood of Hailes," a portion of  Christ's blood
was preserved.</p>

<p id="id01335">26. Go bet: a hunting phrase; apparently its force is, "go beat up
the game."</p>

<p id="id01336">27. Haw; farm-yard, hedge  Compare the French, "haie."</p>

<p id="id01337">28. Avicen, or Avicenna, was among the distinguished
physicians of the Arabian school in the eleventh century, and
very popular in the Middle Ages.  His great work was called
"Canon Medicinae," and was divided into "fens," "fennes," or
sections.</p>

<p id="id01338">29. Assoil:  absolve. compare the Scotch law-term "assoilzie,"
to acquit.</p>

<p id="id01339">30. Saint Helen, according to Sir John Mandeville, found the
cross of Christ deep below ground, under a rock, where the
Jews had hidden it; and she tested the genuineness of the sacred
tree, by raising to life a dead man laid upon it.</p>

<h4 id="id01341" style="margin-top: 2em">THE PROLOGUE</h4>

<p id="id01342" style="margin-top: 2em">Our Host upon his stirrups stood anon,<br>

And saide; "Good men, hearken every one,<br>

This was a thrifty* tale for the nones.            *discreet, profitable<br>

Sir Parish Priest," quoth he, "for Godde's bones,<br>

Tell us a tale, as was thy *forword yore:*            *promise formerly*<br>

I see well that ye learned men in lore<br>

Can* muche good, by Godde's dignity."                              *know<br>

The Parson him answer'd, "Ben'dicite!<br>

What ails the man, so sinfully to swear?"<br>

Our Host answer'd, "O Jankin, be ye there?<br>

Now, good men," quoth our Host, "hearken to me.<br>

I smell a Lollard &lt;2&gt; in the wind," quoth he.<br>

"Abide, for Godde's digne* passion,                              *worthy<br>

For we shall have a predication:<br>

This Lollard here will preachen us somewhat."<br>

"Nay, by my father's soul, that shall he not,<br>

Saide the Shipman; "Here shall he not preach,<br>

He shall no gospel glose* here nor teach.                  *comment upon<br>

We all believe in the great God," quoth he.<br>

"He woulde sowe some difficulty,<br>

Or springe cockle &lt;3&gt; in our cleane corn.<br>

And therefore, Host, I warne thee beforn,<br>

My jolly body shall a tale tell,<br>

And I shall clinke you so merry a bell,<br>

That I shall waken all this company;<br>

But it shall not be of philosophy,<br>

<p id="id01343" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Shipman's Tale</p>

<p id="id01344" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The Prologue here given was transferred by Tyrwhitt from
the place, preceding the Squire's Tale, which it had formerly
occupied; the Shipman's Tale having no Prologue in the best
manuscripts.</p>

<p id="id01345">2. Lollard: A contemptuous name for the followers of
Wyckliffe; presumably derived from the Latin, "lolium," tares,
as if they were the tares among the Lord's wheat; so, a few lines
below, the Shipman intimates his fear lest the Parson should
"spring cockle in our clean corn."</p>

<p id="id01346">3. Cockle: A weed, the "Agrostemma githago" of Linnaeus;
perhaps named from the Anglo-Saxon, "ceocan," because it
chokes the corn.
(Transcriber's note: It is also possible Chaucer had in mind
Matthew 13:25, where in some translations, an enemy sowed
"cockle" amongst the wheat. (Other translations have "tares"
and "darnel".))</p>

Which is a thing that causeth more dispence                merry making*<br>

Than worth is all the cheer and reverence<br>

That men them do at feastes and at dances.<br>

In which array we dance jollily.<br>

<p id="id01349">This noble merchant held a noble house;<br>

For which he had all day so great repair,*           *resort of visitors<br>

For his largesse, and for his wife was fair,<br>

That wonder is; but hearken to my tale.<br>

Amonges all these guestes great and smale,<br>

There was a monk, a fair man and a bold,<br>

I trow a thirty winter he was old,<br>

That ever-in-one* was drawing to that place.                 *constantly<br>

"For to his heart it was a great pleasance.<br>

To buye there a portion of ware;*                           *merchandise<br>

A messenger, and prayed hath Dan John<br>

That he should come to Saint Denis, and play*             *enjoy himself<br>

With him, and with his wife, a day or tway,<br>

This noble monk, of which I you devise,*                           *tell<br>

This merchant and this monk, a day or tway.<br>

The thirde day the merchant up ariseth,<br>

"Nay, cousin mine, it stands not so with me;<br>

And speedily the tables were laid,<br>

And to the dinner faste they them sped,<br>

And richely this monk the chapman fed.<br>

And after dinner Dan John soberly<br>

This chapman took apart, and privily<br>

He said him thus: "Cousin, it standeth so,<br>

Till that Dan John rode unto his abbay.<br>

The morrow came, and forth this merchant rideth<br>

To Flanders-ward, his prentice well him guideth,<br>

<p id="id01364" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Shipman's Tale</p>

<p id="id01365" style="margin-top: 2em">1. In this Tale Chaucer seems to have followed an old French
story, which also formed the groundwork of the first story in
the eighth day of the "Decameron."</p>

<p id="id01366">2. "He must us clothe": So in all the manuscripts and from this
and the following lines, it must be inferred that Chaucer had
intended to put the Tale in  the mouth of a female speaker.</p>

<p id="id01367">3. Dan: a title bestowed on priests and scholars; from
"Dominus," like the Spanish "Don".</p>

<p id="id01368">4. Bruges was in Chaucer's time the great emporium of
European commerce.</p>

<p id="id01369">5. The monk had been appointed by his abbot to inspect and
manage the rural property of the monastery.</p>

<p id="id01370">6. Malvesie or Malmesy wine derived its name from Malvasia, a
region of the Morea near Cape Malea, where it was made, as it
also was on Chios and some other Greek islands. Vernage was
"vernaccia", a sweet Italian wine.</p>

<p id="id01371"> 7. Contour-house: counting-house; French, "comptoir."</p>

<p id="id01372">8. Under the yarde: under the rod; in pupillage; a phrase
properly used of children, but employed by the Clerk in the
prologue to his tale.  See note 1 to the Prologue to the Clerk's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id01373">9. Genelon, Ganelon, or Ganilion; one of Charlemagne's
officers, whose treachery was the cause of the disastrous defeat
of the Christians by the Saracens at Roncevalles; he was torn to
pieces by four horses.</p>

<p id="id01374">10. Elenge:  From French, "eloigner," to remove; it may mean
either the lonely, cheerless condition of the priest, or the strange
behaviour of the merchant in leaving him to himself.</p>

<p id="id01375">11. Make a chevisance: raise money by means of a borrowing
agreement; from French,  "achever," to finish; the general
meaning of the word is a bargain, an agreement.</p>

<p id="id01379" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Prioress's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01380" style="margin-top: 2em">1. A thousand last quad year: ever so much evil.   "Last" means
a load, "quad," bad; and literally we may read "a thousand
weight of bad years." The Italians use "mal anno" in the same
sense.</p>

<p id="id01416" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prioress's Tale</p>

<p id="id01417" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Tales of the murder of children by Jews were frequent in the
Middle Ages, being probably designed to keep up the bitter
feeling of the Christians against the Jews. Not a few children
were canonised on this account; and the scene of the misdeeds
was laid anywhere and everywhere, so that Chaucer could be at
no loss for material.</p>

<p id="id01418">2. This is from Psalm viii. 1, "Domine, dominus noster,quam
admirabile est nomen tuum in universa terra."</p>

<p id="id01419">3. "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast Thou
ordained strength." — Psalms viii. 2.</p>

<p id="id01420">4. The ghost that in thee light: the spirit that on thee alighted;
the Holy Ghost through whose power Christ was conceived.</p>

<p id="id01421">5. Jewery: A quarter which the Jews were permitted to inhabit;
the Old Jewry in London got its name in this way.</p>

<p id="id01422">6. St. Nicholas, even in his swaddling clothes — so says the
"Breviarium Romanum" —gave promise of extraordinary virtue
and holiness; for, though he sucked freely on other days, on
Wednesdays and Fridays he applied to the breast only once, and
that not until the evening.</p>

<p id="id01423">7. "O Alma Redemptoris Mater," ("O soul mother of the
Redeemer") — the beginning of a hymn to the Virgin.</p>

<p id="id01424">8. Antiphonere: A book of anthems, or psalms, chanted in the
choir by alternate verses.</p>

<p id="id01425">9. Souded; confirmed; from French, "soulde;" Latin, "solidatus."</p>

<p id="id01426">10. "And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
were redeemed from the earth.
These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the
firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb."
— Revelations xiv. 3, 4.</p>

<p id="id01427">11. Freined: asked, inquired; from Anglo-Saxon, "frinan,"
"fraegnian." Compare German, "fragen."</p>

<p id="id01428">12. Halse:  embrace or salute; implore: from Anglo-Saxon
"hals," the neck.</p>

<p id="id01429">14 A boy said to have been slain by the Jews at Lincoln in 1255,
according to Matthew Paris.  Many popular ballads were made
about the event, which the diligence of the Church doubtless
kept fresh in mind at Chaucer's day.</p>

<p id="id01436" style="margin-top: 2em">1. This prologue is interesting, for the picture which it gives of
Chaucer himself; riding apart from and indifferent to the rest of
the pilgrims, with eyes fixed on the ground, and an "elvish",
morose, or rather self-absorbed air; portly, if not actually stout,
in body; and evidently a man out of the common, as the closing
words of the Host imply.</p>

<p id="id01474" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to Chaucer's Tale of Sir Thopas</p>

<p id="id01475" style="margin-top: 2em">1. "The Rhyme of Sir Thopas," as it is generally called, is
introduced by Chaucer as a satire on the dull, pompous, and
prolix metrical romances then in vogue. It is full of phrases
taken from the popular rhymesters in the vein which he holds up
to ridicule; if, indeed — though of that there is no evidence — it
be not actually part of an old romance which Chaucer selected
and reproduced to point his assault on the prevailing taste in
literature.
Transcriber's note: The Tale is full of incongruities of every
kind, which Purves does not refer to; I point some of them out
in the notes which follow - marked TN.</p>

<p id="id01476">2. Poppering, or Poppeling, a parish in the marches of Calais of
which the famous antiquary Leland was once Rector. TN: The
inhabitants of Popering had a reputation for stupidity.</p>

<p id="id01477">3. TN: The lord of Popering was the abbot of the local
monastery - who could, of course, have no legitimate children.</p>

<p id="id01478">4. Paindemain: Either "pain de matin," morning bread, or "pain
de Maine," because it was made best in that province; a kind of
fine white bread.</p>

<p id="id01479">5. Cordewane: Cordovan; fine Spanish leather, so called from
the name of the city where it was prepared</p>

<p id="id01480">6. Ciclatoun: A rich Oriental stuff of silk and gold, of which was
made the circular robe of state called a "ciclaton," from the
Latin, "cyclas." The word is French.</p>

<p id="id01481">7. Jane: a Genoese coin, of small value; in our old statutes
called "gallihalpens," or galley half-pence.</p>

<p id="id01482">8. TN: In Mediaeval falconry the goshawk was not regarded as
a fit bird for a knight.  It was the yeoman's bird.</p>

<p id="id01483">9. A ram was the usual prize of wrestling contests. TN:
Wrestling and archery were sports of the common people, not
knightly accomplishments.</p>

<p id="id01484">10. Launcegay: spear; "azagay" is the name of a Moorish
weapon, and the identity of termination is singular.</p>

<p id="id01485">12. Clove-gilofre: clove-gilliflower; "Caryophyllus hortensis."</p>

<p id="id01486">13. TN: The sparrowhawk and parrot can only squawk
unpleasantly.</p>

<p id="id01487">14. TN: The sudden and pointless changes in the stanza form
are of course part of Chaucer's parody.</p>

<p id="id01488">15. Sir Oliphaunt: literally, "Sir Elephant;" Sir John Mandeville
calls those animals "Olyfauntes."</p>

<p id="id01489">16. Termagaunt: A pagan or Saracen deity, otherwise named
Tervagan, and often mentioned in Middle Age literature. His
name has passed into our language, to denote a ranter or
blusterer, as be was represented to be.</p>

<p id="id01490">17. TN: His "fair bearing" would not have been much defence
against a sling-stone.</p>

<p id="id01491">18. TN: "Sides small": a conventional description for a woman,
not a man.</p>

<p id="id01492">19. Romances that be royal:  so called because they related to
Charlemagne and his family.</p>

<p id="id01493">20. TN: A knight would be expected to have a gold or silver
drinking vessel.</p>

<p id="id01494">21. TN: The coat-armour or coat of arms should have had his
heraldic emblems on it, not been pure white</p>

<p id="id01495">22. Charboucle:  Carbuncle; French, "escarboucle;" a heraldic
device resembling a jewel.</p>

<p id="id01496">23. Cuirbouly:  "Cuir boulli," French, boiled or prepared
leather; also used to cover shields, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id01497">24. Rewel bone: No satisfactory explanation has been furnished
of  this word, used to describe some material from which  rich
saddles were made. TN: The OED defines it as narwhal ivory.</p>

<p id="id01498">25. Spell:  Tale, discourse, from Anglo-Saxon, "spellian," to
declare, tell a story.</p>

<p id="id01499">26. Sir Bevis of Hampton, and Sir Guy of Warwick, two
knights of great renown.</p>

<p id="id01500">27. Libeux:  One of Arthur's knights, called "Ly beau
desconus," "the fair unknown."</p>

<p id="id01501">28. TN: The crest was a small emblem worn on top of a knight's
helmet. A tower with a lily stuck in it would have been
unwieldy and absurd.</p>

<p id="id01502">29. Wanger:  pillow; from Anglo-Saxon, "wangere," because
the "wanges;" or cheeks, rested on it.</p>

<p id="id01503">30. Destrer:  "destrier," French, a war-horse; in Latin,
"dextrarius," as if led by the right hand.</p>

<p id="id01504">31. Sir Percival de Galois, whose adventures were written in
more than 60,000 verses by Chretien de Troyes, one of the
oldest and best French romancers, in 1191.</p>

to sheer ignorance the string of pompous platitudes and prosaic
details which Chaucer had uttered.</p>

<p id="id01510">2. Drafty:  worthless, vile; no better than draff or dregs; from

<p id="id01511" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE.&lt;1&gt;</p>

<p id="id01512" style="margin-top: 2em">A young man called Meliboeus, mighty and rich, begat upon his
wife, that called was Prudence, a daughter which that called was
Sophia. Upon a day befell, that he for his disport went into the
fields him to play.  His wife and eke his daughter hath he left
within his house, of which the doors were fast shut. Three of his
old foes have it espied, and set ladders to the walls of his house,
and by the windows be entered, and beaten his wife, and
wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds, in five sundry
places; that is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her
nose, and in her mouth; and left her for dead, and went away.
When Meliboeus returned was into his house, and saw all this
mischief, he, like a man mad, rending his clothes, gan weep and
cry. Prudence his wife, as farforth as she durst, besought him of
his weeping for to stint: but not forthy [notwithstanding] he gan
to weep and cry ever longer the more.</p>

<p id="id01513">This noble wife Prudence remembered her upon the sentence of
Ovid, in his book that called is the "Remedy of Love," &lt;2&gt;
where he saith: He is a fool that disturbeth the mother to weep
in the death of her child, till she have wept her fill, as for a
certain time; and then shall a man do his diligence with amiable
words her to recomfort and pray her of her weeping for to stint
[cease]. For which reason this noble wife Prudence suffered her
husband for to weep and cry, as for a certain space; and when
she saw her time, she said to him in this wise: "Alas! my lord,"
quoth she, "why make ye yourself for to be like a fool? For
sooth it appertaineth not to a wise man to make such a sorrow.
Your daughter, with the grace of God, shall warish [be cured]
and escape. And all [although] were it so that she right now
were dead, ye ought not for her death yourself to destroy.
Seneca saith, 'The wise man shall not take too great discomfort
for the death of his children, but certes he should suffer it in
patience, as well as he abideth the death of his own proper
person.'"</p>

<p id="id01514">Meliboeus answered anon and said: "What man," quoth he,
"should of his weeping stint, that hath so great a cause to weep?
Jesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus
his friend."  Prudence answered, "Certes, well I wot,
attempered [moderate] weeping is nothing defended [forbidden]
to him that sorrowful is, among folk in sorrow but it is rather
granted him to weep.  The Apostle Paul unto the Romans
writeth, 'Man shall rejoice with them that make joy, and weep
with such folk as weep.'  But though temperate weeping be
granted, outrageous weeping certes is defended. Measure of
weeping should be conserved,  after the lore [doctrine] that
teacheth us Seneca.  'When that thy friend is dead,' quoth he, 'let
not thine eyes too moist be of tears, nor too much dry: although
the tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall.  And when thou
hast forgone [lost] thy friend, do diligence to get again another
friend: and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend
which that thou hast lorn [lost] for therein is no boot
[advantage].  And therefore if ye govern you by sapience, put
away sorrow out of your heart. Remember you that Jesus
Sirach saith, 'A man that is joyous and glad in heart, it him
conserveth flourishing in his age: but soothly a sorrowful heart
maketh his bones dry.'  He said eke thus, 'that sorrow in heart
slayth full many a man.' Solomon  saith 'that right as moths in
the sheep's fleece annoy [do injury] to the clothes, and the small
worms to the tree, right so annoyeth sorrow to the heart of
man.' Wherefore us ought as well in the death of our children,
as in the loss of our goods temporal, have patience. Remember
you upon the patient Job, when he had lost his children and his
temporal substance, and in his body endured and received full
many a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus: 'Our Lord hath
given it to me, our Lord hath bereft it me; right as our Lord
would, right so be it done; blessed be the name of our Lord."'</p>

<p id="id01515">To these foresaid things answered Meliboeus unto his wife
Prudence: "All thy words," quoth he, "be true, and thereto
[also] profitable, but truly mine heart is troubled with this
sorrow so grievously, that I know not what to do."  "Let call,"
quoth Prudence, "thy true friends all, and thy lineage, which be
wise, and tell to them your case, and hearken what they say in
counselling, and govern you after their sentence [opinion].
Solomon saith, 'Work all things by counsel, and thou shall never
repent.'" Then, by counsel of his wife Prudence, this Meliboeus
let call [sent for] a great congregation of folk, as surgeons,
physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies
reconciled (as by their semblance) to his love and to his grace;
and therewithal there come some of his neighbours, that did him
reverence more for dread than for love, as happeneth oft. There
come also full many subtle flatterers, and wise advocates
learned in the law. And when these folk together assembled
were, this Meliboeus in sorrowful wise showed them his case,
and by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bare
a cruel ire, ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and suddenly
desired that the war should begin, but nevertheless yet asked he
their counsel in this matter. A surgeon, by licence and assent of
such as were wise, up rose, and to Meliboeus said as ye may
hear.  "Sir," quoth he, "as to us surgeons appertaineth, that we
do to every wight the best that we can, where as we be
withholden, [employed] and to our patient that we do no
damage; wherefore it happeneth many a time and oft, that when
two men have wounded each other, one same surgeon healeth
them both; wherefore unto our art it is not pertinent to nurse
war, nor parties to support [take sides].  But certes, as to the
warishing [healing] of your daughter, albeit so that perilously
she be wounded, we shall do so attentive business from day to
night, that, with the grace of God, she shall be whole and
sound, as soon as is possible." Almost right in the same wise the
physicians answered, save that they said a few words more: that
right as maladies be cured by their contraries, right so shall man
warish war (by peace). His neighbours full of envy, his feigned
friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers, made
semblance of weeping, and impaired and agregged [aggravated]
much of this matter, in praising greatly Meliboeus of might, of
power, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his
adversaries: and said utterly, that he anon should wreak him on
his foes, and begin war.</p>

<p id="id01516">Up rose then an advocate that was wise, by leave and by
counsel of other that were wise, and said, "Lordings, the need
[business] for which we be assembled in this place, is a full
heavy thing, and an high matter, because of the wrong and of
the wickedness that hath been done, and eke by reason of the
great damages that in time coming be possible to fall for the
same cause, and eke by reason of the great riches and power of
the parties both; for which reasons, it were a full great peril to
err in this matter. Wherefore, Meliboeus, this is our sentence
[opinion]; we counsel you, above all things, that right anon thou
do thy diligence in keeping of thy body, in such a wise that thou
want no espy  nor watch thy body to save. And after that, we
counsel that in thine house thou set sufficient garrison, so that
they may as well thy body as thy house defend. But, certes, to
move war or suddenly to do vengeance, we may not deem
[judge] in so little time that it were profitable. Wherefore we
ask leisure and space to have deliberation in this case to deem;
for the common proverb saith thus; 'He that soon deemeth soon
shall repent.' And eke men say, that that judge is wise, that soon
understandeth a matter, and judgeth by leisure. For albeit so
that all tarrying be annoying, algates [nevertheless] it is no
reproof [subject for reproach] in giving of judgement, nor in
vengeance taking, when it is sufficient and, reasonable.  And
that shewed our Lord Jesus Christ by example; for when that
the woman that was taken in adultery was brought in his
presence to know what should be done with her person, albeit
that he wist well himself what he would answer, yet would he
not answer suddenly, but he would have deliberation, and in the
ground he wrote twice. And by these causes we ask deliberation
and we shall then by the grace of God counsel the thing that
shall be profitable."</p>

<p id="id01517">Up started then the young folk anon at once, and the most part
of that company have scorned these old wise men and begun to
make noise and said, "Right as while that iron is hot men should
smite, right so men should wreak their wrongs while that they
be fresh and new:"  and with loud voice they cried. "War! War!"
Up rose then one of these old wise, and with his hand made
countenance [a sign, gesture] that men should hold them still,
and give him audience. "Lordings," quoth he, "there is full many
a man that crieth, 'War! war!' that wot full little what war
amounteth.  War at his beginning hath so great an entering and
so large, that every wight may enter when him liketh, and lightly
[easily] find war: but certes what end shall fall thereof it is not
light to know. For soothly when war is once begun, there is full
many a child unborn of his mother, that shall sterve [die] young
by cause of that war, or else live in sorrow and die in
wretchedness; and therefore, ere that any war be begun, men
must have great counsel and great deliberation."  And when this
old man weened [thought, intended] to enforce his tale by
reasons, well-nigh all at once began they to rise for to break his
tale, and bid him full oft his words abridge. For soothly he that
preacheth to them that list not hear his words, his sermon them
annoyeth. For Jesus Sirach saith, that music in weeping is a
noyous [troublesome] thing.  This is to say, as much availeth to
speak before folk to whom his speech annoyeth, as to sing
before him that weepeth.  And when this wise man saw that him
wanted audience, all shamefast he sat him down again.  For
Solomon saith, 'Where as thou mayest have no audience,
enforce thee not to speak.'  "I  see well," quoth this wise man,
"that the common proverb is sooth, that good counsel wanteth,
when it is most need." Yet [besides, further] had this Meliboeus
in his council many folk, that privily in his ear counselled him
certain thing, and counselled him the contrary in general
audience. When Meliboeus had heard that the greatest part of
his council were accorded [in agreement] that he should make
war, anon he consented to their counselling, and fully affirmed
their sentence [opinion, judgement].</p>

<p id="id01518">(Dame Prudence, seeing her husband's resolution thus taken, in
full humble wise, when she saw her time, begins to counsel him
against war, by a warning against haste in requital of either
good or evil.  Meliboeus tells her that he will not work by her
counsel, because he should be held a fool if he rejected for her
advice the opinion of so many wise men; because all women are
bad; because it would seem that he had given her the mastery
over him; and because she could not keep his secret, if he
resolved to follow her advice. To these reasons Prudence
answers that it is no folly to change counsel when things, or
men's judgements of them, change — especially to alter a
resolution taken on the impulse of a great multitude of folk,
where every man crieth and clattereth what him liketh; that if all
women had been wicked, Jesus Christ would never have
descended to be born of a woman, nor have showed himself
first to a woman after his resurrection and that when Solomon
said he had found no good woman, he meant that God alone
was supremely good; &lt;3&gt; that her husband would not seem to
give her the mastery by following her counsel, for he had his
own free choice in following or rejecting it; and that he knew
well and had often tested her great silence, patience, and
secrecy. And whereas he had quoted a saying, that in wicked
counsel women vanquish men, she reminds him that she would
counsel him against doing a wickedness on which he had set his
mind, and cites instances to show that many women have been
and yet are full good, and their counsel wholesome and
profitable. Lastly, she quotes the words of God himself, when
he was about to make woman as an help meet for man; and
promises that, if her husband will trust her counsel, she will
restore to him his daughter whole and sound, and make him
have honour in this case.  Meliboeus answers that because of his
wife's sweet words, and also because he has proved and assayed
her great wisdom and her great truth, he will govern him by her
counsel in all things. Thus encouraged, Prudence enters on a
long discourse, full of learned citations, regarding the manner in
which counsellors should be chosen and consulted, and the
times and reasons for changing a counsel. First, God must be
besought for guidance. Then a man must well examine his own
thoughts, of such things as he holds to be best for his own
profit; driving out of his heart anger, covetousness, and
hastiness, which perturb and pervert the judgement. Then he
must keep his counsel secret, unless confiding it to another shall
be more profitable; but, in so confiding it, he shall say nothing
to bias the mind of the counsellor toward flattery or
subserviency. After that he should consider his friends and his
enemies, choosing of the former such as be most faithful and
wise, and eldest and most approved in counselling; and even of
these only a few. Then he must eschew the counselling of fools,
of flatterers, of his old enemies that be reconciled, of servants
who bear him great reverence and fear, of folk that be drunken
and can hide no counsel, of such as counsel one thing privily
and the contrary openly; and of young folk, for their counselling
is not ripe. Then, in examining his counsel, he must truly tell his
tale; he must consider whether the thing he proposes to do be
reasonable, within his power, and acceptable to the more part
and the better part of his counsellors; he must look at the things
that may follow from that counselling, choosing the best and
waiving all besides; he must consider the root whence the
matter of his counsel is engendered, what  fruits it may bear,
and from what causes they be sprung.  And having thus
examined his counsel and approved it by many wise folk and
old, he shall consider if he may perform it and make of it a good
end; if he be in doubt, he shall choose rather to suffer than to
begin; but otherwise he shall prosecute his resolution steadfastly
till the enterprise be at an end. As to changing his counsel, a
man may do so without reproach, if the cause cease, or when a
new case betides, or if he find that by error or otherwise harm
or damage may result, or if his counsel be dishonest or come of
dishonest cause, or if it be impossible or may not properly be
kept; and he must take it for a general rule, that every counsel
which is affirmed so strongly, that it may not be changed for
any condition that may betide, that counsel is wicked.
Meliboeus, admitting that his wife had spoken well and suitably
as to counsellors and counsel in general, prays her to tell him in
especial what she thinks of the counsellors whom they have
chosen in their present need. Prudence replies that his counsel in
this case could not properly be called a counselling, but a
movement of folly; and points out that he has erred in sundry
wise against the rules which he had just laid down. Granting
that he has erred, Meliboeus says that he is all ready to change
his counsel right as she will devise; for, as the proverb runs, to
do sin is human, but to persevere long in sin is work of the
Devil. Prudence then minutely recites, analyses, and criticises
the counsel given to her husband in the assembly of his friends.
She commends the advice of the physicians and surgeons, and
urges that they should be well rewarded for their noble speech
and their services in healing Sophia; and she asks Meliboeus
how he understands their proposition that one contrary must be
cured by another contrary. Meliboeus answers, that he should
do vengeance on his enemies, who had done him wrong.
Prudence, however, insists that vengeance is not the contrary of
vengeance, nor wrong of wrong, but the like; and that
wickedness should be healed by goodness, discord by accord,
war by peace.  She proceeds to deal with the counsel of the
lawyers and wise folk that advised Meliboeus to take prudent
measures for the security of his body and of his house. First, she
would have her husband pray for the protection and aid of
Christ; then commit the keeping of his person to his true
friends; then suspect and avoid all strange folk, and liars, and
such people as she had already warned him against; then beware
of presuming on his strength, or the weakness of his adversary,
and neglecting to guard his person — for every wise man
dreadeth his enemy; then he should evermore be on the watch
against ambush and all espial, even in what seems a place of
safety; though he should not be so cowardly, as to fear where is
no cause for dread; yet he should dread to be poisoned, and
therefore shun scorners, and fly their words as venom.  As to
the fortification of his house, she points out that towers and
great edifices are costly and laborious, yet useless unless
defended by true friends that be old and wise; and the greatest
and strongest garrison that a rich man may have, as well to keep
his person as his goods, is, that he be beloved by his subjects
and by his neighbours. Warmly approving the counsel that in all
this business Meliboeus should proceed with great diligence and
deliberation, Prudence goes on to examine the advice given by
his neighbours that do him reverence without love, his old
enemies reconciled, his flatterers that counselled him certain
things privily and openly counselled him the contrary, and the
young folk that counselled him to avenge himself and make war
at once.  She reminds him that he stands alone against three
powerful enemies, whose kindred are numerous and close,
while his are fewer and remote in relationship; that only the
judge who has jurisdiction in a case may take sudden vengeance
on any man; that her husband's power does not accord with his
desire; and that, if he did take vengeance, it would only breed
fresh wrongs and contests. As to the causes of the wrong done
to him, she holds that God, the causer of all things, has
permitted him to suffer because he has drunk so much honey
&lt;4&gt; of sweet temporal riches, and delights, and honours of this
world, that he is drunken, and has forgotten Jesus Christ his
Saviour; the three enemies of mankind, the flesh, the fiend, and
the world, have entered his heart by the windows of his body,
and wounded his soul in five places — that is to say, the deadly
sins that have entered into his heart by the five senses; and in
the same manner Christ has suffered his three enemies to enter
his house by the windows, and wound his daughter in the five
places before specified. Meliboeus demurs, that if his wife's
objections prevailed, vengeance would never be taken, and
thence great mischiefs would arise; but Prudence replies that the
taking of vengeance lies with the judges, to whom the private
individual must have recourse.  Meliboeus declares that such
vengeance does not please him, and that, as Fortune has
nourished and helped him from his childhood, he will now assay
her, trusting, with God's help, that she will aid him to avenge his
shame. Prudence warns him against trusting to Fortune, all the
less because she has hitherto favoured him, for just on that
account she is the more likely to fail him; and she calls on him
to leave his vengeance with the Sovereign Judge, that avengeth
all villainies and wrongs. Meliboeus argues that if he refrains
from taking vengeance he will invite his enemies to do him
further wrong, and he will be put and held over low; but
Prudence contends that such a result can be brought about only
by the neglect of the judges, not by the patience of the
individual.  Supposing that he had leave to avenge himself, she
repeats that he is not strong enough, and quotes the common
saw, that it is madness for a man to strive with a stronger than
himself, peril to strive with one of equal strength, and folly to
strive with a weaker. But, considering his own defaults and
demerits, — remembering the patience of Christ and the
undeserved tribulations of the saints, the brevity of this life with
all its trouble and sorrow, the discredit thrown on the wisdom
and training of  a man who cannot bear wrong with patience —
he should refrain wholly from taking vengeance. Meliboeus
submits that he is not at all a perfect man, and his heart will
never be at peace until he is avenged; and that as his enemies
disregarded the peril when they attacked him, so he might,
without reproach, incur some peril in attacking them in return,
even though he did a great excess in avenging one wrong by
another. Prudence strongly deprecates all outrage or excess; but
Meliboeus insists that he cannot see that it might greatly harm
him though he took a vengeance, for he is richer and mightier
than his enemies, and all things obey money. Prudence
thereupon launches into a long dissertation on the advantages of
riches, the evils of poverty, the means by which wealth should
be gathered, and the manner in which it should be used; and
concludes by counselling her husband not to move war and
battle through trust in his riches, for they suffice not to maintain
war, the battle is not always to the strong or the numerous, and
the perils of conflict are many. Meliboeus then curtly asks her
for her counsel how he shall do in this need; and she answers
that certainly she counsels him to agree with his adversaries and
have peace with them. Meliboeus on this cries out that plainly
she loves not his honour or his worship, in counselling him to
go and humble himself before his enemies, crying mercy to them
that, having done him so grievous wrong, ask him not to be
reconciled. Then Prudence, making semblance of wrath, retorts
that she loves his honour and profit as she loves her own, and
ever has done; she cites the Scriptures in support of her counsel
to seek peace; and says she will leave him to his own courses,
for she knows well he is so stubborn, that he will do nothing for
her. Meliboeus then relents; admits that he is angry and cannot
judge aright; and puts himself wholly in her hands, promising to
do just as she desires, and admitting that he is the more held to
love and praise her, if she reproves him of his folly)</p>

<p id="id01519">Then Dame Prudence discovered all her counsel and her will
unto him, and said: "I counsel you," quoth she, "above all
things, that ye make peace between God and you, and be
reconciled unto Him and to his grace; for, as I have said to you
herebefore, God hath suffered you to have this tribulation and
disease [distress, trouble] for your sins; and if ye do as I say
you, God will send your adversaries unto you, and make them
fall at your feet, ready to do your will and your commandment.
For Solomon saith, 'When the condition of man is pleasant and
liking to God, he changeth the hearts of the man's adversaries,
and constraineth them to beseech him of peace of grace.'  And I
pray you let me speak with your adversaries in privy place, for
they shall not know it is by your will or your assent; and then,
when I know their will and their intent, I may counsel you the
more surely." '"Dame," quoth Meliboeus, '"do your will and
your liking, for I put me wholly in your disposition and
ordinance."</p>

<p id="id01520">Then Dame Prudence, when she saw the goodwill of her
husband, deliberated and took advice in herself, thinking how
she might bring this need [affair, emergency] unto a good end.
And when she saw her time, she sent for these adversaries to
come into her into a privy place, and showed wisely into them
the great goods that come of peace, and the great harms and
perils that be in war; and said to them, in goodly manner, how
that they ought have great repentance of the injuries and
wrongs that they had done to Meliboeus her Lord, and unto her
and her daughter.  And when they heard the goodly words of
Dame Prudence, then they were surprised and ravished, and had
so great joy of her, that wonder was to tell.  "Ah lady!" quoth
they, "ye have showed unto us the blessing of sweetness, after
the saying of David the prophet; for the reconciling which we
be not worthy to have in no manner, but we ought require it
with great contrition and humility, ye of your great goodness
have presented unto us. Now see we well, that the science and
conning [knowledge] of Solomon is full true; for he saith, that
sweet words multiply and increase friends, and make shrews
[the ill-natured or angry] to be debonair [gentle, courteous] and
meek.  Certes we put our deed, and all our matter and cause, all
wholly in your goodwill, and be ready to obey unto the speech
and commandment of my lord Meliboeus. And therefore, dear
and benign lady, we pray you and beseech you as meekly as we
can and may, that it like unto your great goodness to fulfil in
deed your goodly words. For we consider and acknowledge
that we have offended and grieved my lord Meliboeus out of
measure, so far forth that we be not of power to make him
amends; and therefore we oblige and bind us and our friends to
do all his will and his commandment. But peradventure he hath
such heaviness and such wrath to usward, [towards us] because
of our offence, that he will enjoin us such a pain [penalty] as we
may not bear nor sustain; and therefore, noble lady, we beseech
to your womanly pity to take such advisement [consideration]
in this need, that we, nor our friends, be not disinherited and
destroyed through our folly."</p>

<p id="id01521">"Certes," quoth Prudence, "it is an hard thing, and right
perilous, that a man put him all utterly in the arbitration and
judgement and in the might and power of his enemy. For
Solomon saith, 'Believe me, and give credence to that that I
shall say: to thy son, to thy wife, to thy friend, nor to thy
brother, give thou never might nor mastery over thy body, while
thou livest.'  Now, since he defendeth [forbiddeth] that a man
should not give to his brother, nor to his friend, the might of his
body, by a stronger reason he defendeth and forbiddeth a man
to give himself to his enemy. And nevertheless, I counsel you
that ye mistrust not my lord: for I wot well and know verily,
that he is debonair and meek, large, courteous and nothing
desirous nor envious of good nor riches: for there is nothing in
this world that he desireth save only worship and honour.
Furthermore I know well, and am right sure, that he shall
nothing do in this need without counsel of me; and I shall so
work in this case, that by the grace of our Lord God ye shall be
reconciled unto us."</p>

<p id="id01522">Then said they with one voice, ""Worshipful lady, we put us
and our goods all fully in your will and disposition, and be ready
to come, what day that it like unto your nobleness to limit us or
assign us, for to make our obligation and bond, as strong as it
liketh unto your goodness, that we may fulfil the will of you and
of my lord Meliboeus."</p>

<p id="id01523">When Dame Prudence had heard the answer of these men, she
bade them go again privily, and she returned to her lord
Meliboeus, and told him how she found his adversaries full
repentant, acknowledging full lowly their sins and trespasses,
and how they were ready to suffer all pain, requiring and
praying him of mercy and pity. Then said Meliboeus, "He is well
worthy to have pardon and forgiveness of his sin, that excuseth
not his sin, but acknowledgeth, and repenteth him, asking
indulgence.  For Seneca saith, 'There is the remission and
forgiveness, where the confession is; for confession is neighbour
to innocence.' And therefore I assent and confirm me to have
peace, but it is good that we do naught without the assent and
will of our friends." Then was Prudence right glad and joyful,
and said, "Certes, Sir, ye be well and goodly advised; for right
as by the counsel, assent, and help of your friends ye have been
stirred to avenge you and make war, right so without their
counsel shall ye not accord you, nor have peace with your
adversaries. For the law saith, 'There is nothing so good by way
of kind, [nature] as a thing to be unbound by him that it was
bound.'"</p>

<p id="id01524">And then Dame Prudence, without delay or tarrying, sent anon
her messengers for their kin and for their old friends, which
were true and wise; and told them by order, in the presence of
Meliboeus, all this matter, as it is above expressed and declared;
and prayed them that they would give their advice and counsel
what were best to do in this need. And when Meliboeus' friends
had taken their advice and deliberation of the foresaid matter,
and had examined it by great business and great diligence, they
gave full counsel for to have peace and rest, and that Meliboeus
should with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness
and mercy. And when Dame Prudence had heard the assent of
her lord Meliboeus, and the counsel of his friends, accord with
her will and her intention, she was wondrous glad in her heart,
and said: "There is an old proverb that saith, 'The goodness that
thou mayest do this day, do it, and abide not nor delay it not till
to-morrow:' and therefore I counsel you that ye send your
messengers, such as be discreet and wise, unto your adversaries,
telling them on your behalf, that if they will treat of peace and
of accord, that they shape [prepare] them, without delay or
tarrying, to come unto us." Which thing performed was indeed.
And when these trespassers and repenting folk of their follies,
that is to say, the adversaries of Meliboeus, had heard what
these messengers said unto them, they were right glad and
joyful, and answered full meekly and benignly, yielding graces
and thanks to their lord Meliboeus, and to all his company; and
shaped them without delay to go with the messengers, and obey
to the commandment of their lord Meliboeus.  And right anon
they took their way to the court of Meliboeus, and took with
them some of their true friends, to make faith for them, and for
to be their borrows [sureties].</p>

<p id="id01525">And when they were come to the presence of Meliboeus, he
said to them these words; "It stands thus," quoth Meliboeus,
"and sooth it is, that ye causeless, and without skill and reason,
have done great injuries and wrongs to me, and to my wife
Prudence, and to my daughter also; for ye have entered into my
house by violence, and have done such outrage, that all men
know well that ye have deserved the death: and therefore will I
know and weet of you, whether ye will put the punishing and
chastising, and the vengeance of this outrage, in the will of me
and of my wife, or ye will not?" Then the wisest of them three
answered for them all, and said; "Sir," quoth he, "we know well,
that we be I unworthy to come to the court of so great a lord
and so worthy as ye be, for we have so greatly mistaken us, and
have offended and aguilt [incurred guilt] in such wise against
your high lordship, that truly we have deserved the death. But
yet for the great goodness and debonairte [courtesy, gentleness]
that all the world witnesseth of your person, we submit us to
the excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship, and be
ready to obey to all your commandments, beseeching you, that
of your  merciable [merciful] pity ye will consider our great
repentance and low submission, and grant us forgiveness of our
outrageous trespass and offence; for well we know, that your
liberal grace and mercy stretch them farther into goodness, than
do our outrageous guilt and trespass into wickedness; albeit that
cursedly [wickedly] and damnably we have aguilt [incurred
guilt] against your high lordship." Then Meliboeus took them
up from the ground full benignly, and received their obligations
and their bonds, by their oaths upon their pledges and borrows,
[sureties] and assigned them a certain day to return unto his
court for to receive and accept sentence and judgement, that
Meliboeus would command to be done on them, by the causes
aforesaid; which things ordained, every man returned home to
his house.</p>

<p id="id01526">And when that Dame Prudence saw her time she freined
[inquired] and asked her lord Meliboeus, what vengeance he
thought to take of his adversaries. To which Meliboeus
answered, and said; "Certes," quoth he, "I think and purpose me
fully to disinherit them of all that ever they have, and for to put
them in exile for evermore." "Certes," quoth Dame Prudence,
"this were a cruel sentence, and much against reason. For ye be
rich enough, and have no need of other men's goods; and ye
might lightly [easily] in this wise get you a covetous name,
which is a vicious thing, and ought to be eschewed of every
good man: for, after the saying of the Apostle, covetousness is
root of all harms. And therefore it were better for you to lose
much good of your own, than for to take of their good in this
manner. For better it is to lose good with worship [honour],
than to win good with villainy and shame. And every man ought
to do his diligence and his business to get him a good name.
And yet [further] shall he not only busy him in keeping his good
name, but he shall also enforce him alway to do some thing by
which he may renew his good name; for it is written, that the
old good los [reputation &lt;5&gt;] of a man is soon gone and
passed, when it is not renewed.  And as touching that ye say,
that ye will exile your adversaries, that thinketh ye much against
reason, and out of measure, [moderation] considered the power
that they have given you upon themselves. And it is written,
that he is worthy to lose his privilege, that misuseth the might
and the power that is given him.  And I set case [if I assume] ye
might enjoin them that pain by right and by law (which I trow
ye may not do), I say, ye might not put it to execution
peradventure, and then it were like to return to the war, as it
was before.  And therefore if ye will that men do you obeisance,
ye must deem [decide] more courteously, that is to say, ye must
give more easy sentences and judgements. For it is written, 'He
that most courteously commandeth, to him men most obey.'
And therefore I pray you, that in this necessity and in this need
ye cast you [endeavour, devise a way] to overcome your heart.
For Seneca saith, that he that overcometh his heart, overcometh
twice. And Tullius saith, 'There is nothing so commendable in a
great lord, as when he is debonair and meek, and appeaseth him
lightly [easily].' And I pray you, that ye will now forbear to do
vengeance, in such a manner, that your good name may be kept
and conserved, and that men may have cause and matter to
praise you of pity and of mercy; and that ye have no cause to
repent you of thing that ye do. For Seneca saith, 'He
overcometh in an evil manner, that repenteth him of his victory.'
Wherefore I pray you let mercy be in your heart, to the effect
and intent that God Almighty have mercy upon you in his last
judgement; for Saint James saith in his Epistle, 'Judgement
without mercy shall be done to him, that hath no mercy of
another wight.'"</p>

<p id="id01527">When Meliboeus had heard the great skills [arguments, reasons]
and reasons of Dame Prudence, and her wise information and
teaching, his heart gan incline to the will of his wife, considering
her true intent, he conformed him anon and assented fully to
work after her counsel, and thanked God, of whom proceedeth
all goodness and all virtue, that him sent a wife of so great
discretion. And when the day came that his adversaries should
appear in his presence, he spake to them full goodly, and said in
this wise; "Albeit so, that of your pride and high presumption
and folly, an of your negligence and unconning, [ignorance] ye
have misborne [misbehaved] you, and trespassed [done injury]
unto me, yet forasmuch as I see and behold your great humility,
and that ye be sorry and repentant of your guilts, it constraineth
me to do you grace and mercy. Wherefore I receive you into my
grace, and forgive you utterly all the offences, injuries, and
wrongs, that ye have done against me and mine, to this effect
and to this end, that God of his endless mercy will at the time of
our dying forgive us our guilts, that we have trespassed to him
in this wretched world; for doubtless, if we be sorry and
repentant of the sins and guilts which we have trespassed in the
sight of our Lord God, he is so free and so merciable [merciful],
that he will forgive us our guilts, and bring us to the bliss that
never hath end." Amen.</p>

<p id="id01528" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to Chaucer's Tale of Meliboeus.</p>

<p id="id01529" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The Tale of Meliboeus is literally translated from a French
story, or rather "treatise," in prose, entitled "Le Livre de
Melibee et de Dame Prudence," of which two manuscripts, both
dating from the fifteenth century, are preserved in the British
Museum. Tyrwhitt, justly enough, says of it that it is indeed, as
Chaucer called it in the prologue, "'a moral tale virtuous,' and
was probably much esteemed in its time; but, in this age of
levity, I doubt some readers will be apt to regret that he did not
rather give us the remainder of Sir Thopas."  It has been
remarked that in the earlier portion of the Tale, as it left the
hand of the poet, a number of blank verses were intermixed;
though this peculiarity of style, noticeable in any case only in
the first 150 or 200 lines, has necessarily all but disappeared by
the changes of spelling made in the modern editions. The
Editor's purpose being to present to the public not "The
Canterbury Tales" merely, but "The Poems of Chaucer," so far
as may be consistent with the limits of this volume, he has
condensed the long reasonings and learned quotations of Dame
Prudence into a mere outline, connecting those portions of the
Tale wherein lies so much of story as it actually possesses, and
the general reader will probably not regret the sacrifice, made in
the view of retaining so far as possible the completeness of the
Tales, while lessening the intrusion of prose into a volume or
poems.  The good wife of Meliboeus literally overflows with
quotations from David, Solomon, Jesus the Son of Sirach, the
Apostles, Ovid, Cicero, Seneca, Cassiodorus, Cato, Petrus
Alphonsus — the converted Spanish Jew, of the twelfth century,
who wrote the "Disciplina Clericalis"  — and other authorities;
and in some passages, especially where husband and wife debate
the merits or demerits of women, and where Prudence dilates
on the evils of poverty, Chaucer only reproduces much that had
been said already in the Tales that preceded — such as the
Merchant's and the Man of Law's.</p>

<p id="id01643" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Monk's Tale</p>

<p id="id01644" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The Monk's Tale is founded in its main features on
Bocccacio's work, "De Casibus Virorum Illustrium;" ("Stories
of Illustrious Men") but Chaucer has taken the separate stories
of which it is composed from different authors, and dealt with
them after his own fashion.</p>

<p id="id01645"> 2. Boccaccio opens his book with Adam, whose story is told at
much greater length than here. Lydgate, in his translation from
Boccaccio, speaks of Adam and Eve as made  "of slime of the
erth in Damascene the felde."</p>

<p id="id01646">3.  Judges xiii. 3. Boccaccio also tells the story of Samson; but
Chaucer seems, by his quotation a few lines below, to have
taken his version direct from the sacred book.</p>

<p id="id01647">4. Oliveres: olive trees; French, "oliviers."</p>

<p id="id01648">5. "Liber Judicum," the Book of Judges; chap. xv.</p>

<p id="id01649">6. Querne:  mill; from Anglo-Saxon, "cyrran," to turn,
"cweorn," a mill,</p>

<p id="id01650">7.Harpies: the Stymphalian Birds, which fed on human flesh.</p>

<p id="id01651">8.  Busiris, king of Egypt, was wont to sacrifice all foreigners
coming to his dominions. Hercules was seized, bound, and led
to the altar by his orders, but the hero broke his bonds and slew
the tyrant.</p>

<p id="id01652">9. The feats of Hercules here recorded are not all these known
as the "twelve labours;" for instance, the cleansing of the
Augean stables, and the capture of Hippolyte's girdle are not in
this list — other and less famous deeds of the hero taking their
place. For this, however, we must accuse not Chaucer, but
Boethius, whom he has almost literally translated, though with
some change of order.</p>

<p id="id01653">10. Trophee:  One of the manuscripts has a marginal reference
to "Tropheus vates Chaldaeorum" ("Tropheus the prophet of
the Chaldees"); but it is not known what author Chaucer meant
— unless the reference is to a passage in the "Filostrato" of
Boccaccio, on which Chaucer founded his "Troilus and
Cressida," and which Lydgate mentions, under the name of
"Trophe," as having been translated by Chaucer.</p>

<p id="id01654">11. Pres: near; French, "pres;" the meaning seems to be, this
nearer, lower world.</p>

<p id="id01655">12 Chaucer has taken the story of Zenobia from Boccaccio's
work "De Claris Mulieribus." ("Of Illustrious Women")</p>

<p id="id01656">13.  Odenatus, who, for his services to the Romans, received
from Gallienus the title of  "Augustus;" he was assassinated in
A.D. 266 — not, it was believed, without the connivance of
Zenobia, who succeeded him on the throne.</p>

<p id="id01657">14. Sapor was king of Persia, who made the Emperor Valerian
prisoner, conquered Syria, and was pressing triumphantly
westward when he was met and defeated by Odenatus and
Zenobia.</p>

<p id="id01658">15. Aurelain became Emperor in A.D. 270.</p>

<p id="id01659">16. Vitremite:  The signification of this word,  which is spelled
in several ways, is not known. Skinner's explanation, "another
attire," founded on the spelling "autremite," is obviously
insufficient.</p>

<p id="id01660">17. Great part of this "tragedy" of Nero is really borrowed,
however, from the "Romance of the Rose."</p>

<p id="id01661">18. Trice:  thrust; from Anglo-Saxon, "thriccan."</p>

<p id="id01662">19. So, in the Man of  Law's Tale, the Sultaness promises her
son that she will "reny her lay."</p>

<p id="id01663">20. As the "tragedy" of Holofernes is founded on the book of
Judith, so is that of Antiochus on the Second Book of the
Maccabees, chap. ix.</p>

<p id="id01664">21. By the insurgents under the leadership of Judas Maccabeus;
2 Macc. chap. viii.</p>

<p id="id01665">22. Six:  the highest cast on a dicing-cube; here representing the
highest favour of fortune.</p>

<p id="id01666">23. Pompey had married his daughter Julia to Caesar; but she
died six years before Pompey's final overthrow.</p>

<p id="id01667">24. At the battle of Pharsalia, B.C. 48.</p>

<p id="id01668">25. Word and end: apparently a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon
phrase, "ord and end," meaning the whole, the beginning and
the end.</p>

<p id="id01669">26. At the opening of the story of Croesus, Chaucer has copied
from his own translation of Boethius; but the story is mainly
taken from the "Romance of the Rose"</p>

<p id="id01670">27. "This reflection," says Tyrwhttt, "seems to have been
suggested by one which follows soon after the mention of
Croesus in the passage just cited from Boethius. 'What other
thing bewail the cryings of tragedies but only the deeds of
fortune, that with an awkward stroke, overturneth the realms of
great nobley?'" —  in some manuscripts the four "tragedies" that
follow are placed between those of Zenobia and Nero; but
although the general reflection with which the "tragedy" of
Croesus closes might most appropriately wind up the whole
series, the general chronological arrangement which is observed
in the other cases recommends the order followed in the text.
Besides, since, like several other Tales, the Monk's tragedies
were cut short by the impatience of the auditors, it is more
natural that the Tale should close abruptly, than by such a
rhetorical finish as these lines afford.</p>

<p id="id01671">28. Pedro the Cruel, King of Aragon, against whom his brother
Henry rebelled. He was by false pretences inveigled into his
brother's tent, and treacherously slain. Mr Wright has remarked
that "the cause of Pedro, though he was no better than a cruel
and reckless tyrant, was popular in England from the very
circumstance that Prince Edward (the Black Prince) had
embarked in it."</p>

<p id="id01672">29. Not the Oliver of Charlemagne — but a traitorous Oliver of
Armorica, corrupted by a bribe. Ganilion was the betrayer of
the Christian army at Roncevalles (see note 9 to the Shipman's
Tale); and his name appears to have been for a long time used in
France to denote a traitor. Duguesclin, who betrayed Pedro into
his brother's tent, seems to be intended by the term "Ganilion
Oliver," but if so, Chaucer has mistaken his name, which was
Bertrand — perhaps confounding him, as Tyrwhttt suggests,
with Oliver du Clisson, another illustrious Breton of those
times, who was also Constable of France, after Duguesclin. The
arms of the latter are supposed to be described a little above</p>

<p id="id01673">30. Pierre de Lusignan, King of Cyprus, who captured
Alexandria in 1363 (see note 6 to the Prologue to the Tales).
He was assassinated in 1369.</p>

<p id="id01674">31. Bernabo Visconti, Duke of Milan, was deposed and
imprisoned by his nephew, and died a captive in 1385. His death
is the latest historical fact mentioned in the Tales; and thus it
throws the date of their composition to about the sixtieth year
of Chaucer's age.</p>

<p id="id01675">32. The story of Ugolino is told in the 33rd Canto of the
"Inferno."</p>

<p id="id01678" style="margin-top: 2em">"Ho!" quoth the Knight, "good sir, no more of this;<br>

That ye have said is right enough, y-wis,*                  *of a surety<br>

It is for to bewaile, nor complain<br>

Sir Monk, no more of this, so God you bless;<br>

Your tale annoyeth all this company;<br>

</p>

<p id="id01680">"Nay," quoth the Monk, "I have *no lust to play;*       *no fondness for<br>

Now let another tell, as I have told."                          jesting*<br>

</p>

<p id="id01681">"Yes, Host," quoth he, "so may I ride or go,<br>

But* I be merry, y-wis I will be blamed."                        *unless<br>

<p id="id01682" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Nun's Priest's Tale</p>

<p id="id01683" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The request is justified by the description of Monk in the
Prologue as "an out-rider, that loved venery."</p>

<p id="id01684">2. On this Tyrwhitt remarks; "I know not how it has happened,
that in the principal modern languages, John, or its equivalent,
is a name of contempt or at least of slight.  So the Italians use
'Gianni,' from whence 'Zani;' the Spaniards 'Juan,' as 'Bobo
Juan,' a foolish John; the French 'Jean,' with various additions;
and in English, when we call a man 'a John,' we do not mean it
as a title of honour."  The title of "Sir" was usually given by
courtesy to priests.</p>

<p id="id01685">3. Attamed: commenced, broached. Compare French, "entamer",
to cut the first piece off a joint; thence to begin.</p>

<p id="id01686" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE. &lt;1&gt;</p>

<p id="id01687" style="margin-top: 2em">A poor widow, *somedeal y-stept* in age,             *somewhat advanced*<br>

Was whilom dwelling in a poor cottage,<br>

Beside a grove, standing in a dale.<br>

This widow, of which I telle you my tale,<br>

Since thilke day that she was last a wife,<br>

In patience led a full simple life,<br>

For little was *her chattel and her rent.*    *her goods and her income*<br>

By husbandry* of such as God her sent,               *thrifty management<br>

She found* herself, and eke her daughters two.               *maintained<br>

Three large sowes had she, and no mo';<br>

Three kine, and eke a sheep that highte Mall.<br>

Full sooty was her bow'r,* and eke her hall,                    *chamber<br>

In which she ate full many a slender meal.<br>

Of poignant sauce knew she never a deal.*                          *whit<br>

No dainty morsel passed through her throat;<br>

Her diet was *accordant to her cote.*      *in keeping with her cottage*<br>

Repletion her made never sick;<br>

Attemper* diet was all her physic,                             *moderate<br>

And exercise, and *hearte's suffisance.*          *contentment of heart*<br>

The goute *let her nothing for to dance,*           *did not prevent her<br>

Nor apoplexy shente* not her head.                 from dancing*   *hurt<br>

No wine drank she, neither white nor red:<br>

Her board was served most with white and black,<br>

Milk and brown bread, in which she found no lack,<br>

Seind* bacon, and sometimes an egg or tway;                      *singed<br>

For she was as it were *a manner dey.*        *kind of day labourer* &lt;2&gt;<br>

A yard she had, enclosed all about<br>

With stickes, and a drye ditch without,<br>

In which she had a cock, hight Chanticleer;<br>

In all the land of crowing *n'as his peer.*          *was not his equal*<br>

His voice was merrier than the merry orgon,*                  *organ &lt;3&gt;<br>

On masse days that in the churches gon.<br>

Well sickerer* was his crowing in his lodge,             *more punctual*<br>

Than is a clock, or an abbay horloge.*                        *clock &lt;4&gt;<br>

By nature he knew each ascension<br>

Of th' equinoctial in thilke town;<br>

For when degrees fiftene were ascended,<br>

Then crew he, that it might not be amended.<br>

His comb was redder than the fine coral,<br>

Embattell'd &lt;5&gt; as it were a castle wall.<br>

His bill was black, and as the jet it shone;<br>

Like azure were his legges and his tone;*                          *toes<br>

His nailes whiter than the lily flow'r,<br>

And like the burnish'd gold was his colour,<br>

This gentle cock had in his governance<br>

Sev'n hennes, for to do all his pleasance,<br>

Which were his sisters and his paramours,<br>

And wondrous like to him as of colours.<br>

Of which the fairest-hued in the throat<br>

Was called Damoselle Partelote,<br>

Courteous she was, discreet, and debonair,<br>

And companiable,* and bare herself so fair,                    *sociable<br>

Since the day that she sev'n night was old,<br>

That truely she had the heart in hold<br>

Of Chanticleer, locked in every lith;*                             *limb<br>

But such a joy it was to hear them sing,<br>

When that the brighte sunne gan to spring,<br>

In sweet accord, *"My lefe is fare in land."* &lt;6&gt;            *my love is<br>

As man that in his dream is dretched* sore,                   *oppressed<br>

And when that Partelote thus heard him roar,<br>

She was aghast,* and saide, "Hearte dear,                        *afraid<br>

His colour was betwixt yellow and red;<br>

And each of them went to his hostelry,*                             *inn<br>

And took his lodging as it woulde fall.<br>

The one of them was lodged in a stall,<br>

Far in a yard, with oxen of the plough;<br>

That other man was lodged well enow,<br>

As was his aventure, or his fortune,<br>

That us governeth all, as in commune.<br>

And so befell, that, long ere it were day,<br>

This man mette* in his bed, there: as he lay,                   *dreamed<br>

How that his fellow gan upon him call,<br>

And said, 'Alas! for in an ox's stall<br>

This night shall I be murder'd, where I lie<br>

Now help me, deare brother, or I die;<br>

In alle haste come to me,' he said.<br>

This man out of his sleep for fear abraid;*                     *started<br>

But when that he was wak'd out of his sleep,<br>

He turned him, and *took of this no keep;*      *paid this no attention*<br>

He thought his dream was but a vanity.<br>

Thus twies* in his sleeping dreamed he,                           *twice<br>

And at the thirde time yet his fellaw again<br>

Came, as he thought, and said, 'I am now slaw;*                   *slain<br>

Behold my bloody woundes, deep and wide.<br>

Arise up early, in the morning, tide,<br>

And at the west gate of the town,' quoth he,<br>

'A carte full of dung there shalt: thou see,<br>

In which my body is hid privily.<br>

Do thilke cart arroste* boldely.                                   *stop<br>

My gold caused my murder, sooth to sayn.'<br>

And told him every point how he was slain,<br>

With a full piteous face, and pale of hue.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01691">"And, truste well, his dream he found full true;<br>

For on the morrow, as soon as it was day,<br>

To his fellowes inn he took his way;<br>

And when that he came to this ox's stall,<br>

After his fellow he began to call.<br>

The hostelere answered him anon,<br>

And saide, 'Sir, your fellow is y-gone,<br>

As soon as day he went out of the town.'<br>

This man gan fallen in suspicioun,<br>

Rememb'ring on his dreames that he mette,*                      *dreamed<br>

And forth he went, no longer would he let,*                       *delay<br>

Unto the west gate of the town, and fand*                         *found<br>

A dung cart, as it went for to dung land,<br>

That was arrayed in the same wise<br>

As ye have heard the deade man devise;*                        *describe<br>

And with an hardy heart he gan to cry,<br>

'Vengeance and justice of this felony:<br>

My fellow murder'd in this same night<br>

And in this cart he lies, gaping upright.<br>

I cry out on the ministers,' quoth he.<br>

'That shoulde keep and rule this city;<br>

Harow! alas! here lies my fellow slain.'<br>

What should I more unto this tale sayn?<br>

The people out start, and cast the cart to ground<br>

And in the middle of the dung they found<br>

The deade man, that murder'd was all new.<br>

O blissful God! that art so good and true,<br>

Lo, how that thou bewray'st murder alway.<br>

Murder will out, that see we day by day.<br>

Murder is so wlatsom* and abominable                          *loathsome<br>

To God, that is so just and reasonable,<br>

That he will not suffer it heled* be;                    *concealed &lt;14&gt;<br>

Though it abide a year, or two, or three,<br>

Murder will out, this is my conclusioun,<br>

And right anon, the ministers of the town<br>

Have hent* the carter, and so sore him pined,**       *seized **tortured<br>

And eke the hostelere so sore engined,*                          *racked<br>

That they beknew* their wickedness anon,                      *confessed<br>

For certain cause, into a far country,<br>

If that the wind not hadde been contrary,<br>

That made them in a city for to tarry,<br>

That stood full merry upon an haven side;<br>

The wind gan change, and blew right *as them lest.*     *as they wished*<br>

Jolly and glad they wente to their rest,<br>

And caste* them full early for to sail.                        *resolved<br>

But to the one man fell a great marvail<br>

That one of them, in sleeping as he lay,<br>

He mette* a wondrous dream, against the day:                    *dreamed<br>

He thought a man stood by his bedde's side,<br>

And him commanded that he should abide;<br>

And said him thus; 'If thou to-morrow wend,<br>

Thou shalt be drown'd; my tale is at an end.'<br>

He woke, and told his follow what he mette,<br>

And prayed him his voyage for to let;*                            *delay<br>

As for that day, he pray'd him to abide.<br>

His fellow, that lay by his bedde's side,<br>

Gan for to laugh, and scorned him full fast.<br>

'No dream,' quoth he,'may so my heart aghast,*                 *frighten<br>

That I will lette* for to do my things.*                          *delay<br>

God wot, *it rueth me;* and have good day.'          *I am sorry for it*<br>

And thus he took his leave, and went his way.<br>

But, ere that he had half his course sail'd,<br>

I know not why, nor what mischance it ail'd,<br>

But casually* the ship's bottom rent,                       *by accident<br>

And ship and man under the water went,<br>

Of Mercenrike, &lt;16&gt; how Kenelm mette a thing.<br>

In Afric' of the worthy Scipion, &lt;17&gt;<br>

Affirmeth dreames, and saith that they be<br>

'Warnings of thinges that men after see.<br>

And furthermore, I pray you looke well<br>

In the Old Testament, of Daniel,<br>

If he held dreames any vanity.<br>

Read eke of Joseph, and there shall ye see<br>

Whether dreams be sometimes (I say not all)<br>

Warnings of thinges that shall after fall.<br>

Look of Egypt the king, Dan Pharaoh,<br>

His baker and his buteler also,<br>

Whether they felte none effect* in dreams.                 *significance<br>

Whoso will seek the acts of sundry remes*                        *realms<br>

Lo Croesus, which that was of Lydia king,<br>

Lo here, Andromache, Hectore's wife, &lt;19&gt;<br>

That day that Hector shoulde lose his life,<br>

Adversity; and I say furthermore,<br>

That I ne *tell of laxatives no store,*                  *hold laxatives<br>

Royal he was, he was no more afear'd;<br>

He feather'd Partelote twenty time,<br>

He chucked, when he had a corn y-found,<br>

And to him ranne then his wives all.<br>

Thus royal, as a prince is in his hall,<br>

Was complete, and y-passed were also,<br>

Since March ended, thirty days and two,<br>

Befell that Chanticleer in all his pride,<br>

His seven wives walking him beside,<br>

Cast up his eyen to the brighte sun,<br>

That in school is great altercation<br>

In this matter, and great disputation,<br>

And hath been of an hundred thousand men.<br>

But I ne cannot *boult it to the bren,*     *examine it thoroughly &lt;26&gt;*<br>

That took his counsel of his wife, with sorrow,<br>

To walken in the yard upon the morrow<br>

That he had mette the dream, as I you told.<br>

Womane's counsels be full often cold;*              *mischievous, unwise<br>

Womane's counsel brought us first to woe,<br>

Read authors, where they treat of such mattere<br>

How that they singe well and merrily. &lt;28&gt;<br>

And so befell that, as he cast his eye<br>

Among the wortes,* on a butterfly,                             *cabbages<br>

He was ware of this fox that lay full low.<br>

Nothing *ne list him thenne* for to crow,        *he had no inclination*<br>

Said, "Gentle Sir, alas! why will ye gon?<br>

If I to you would harm or villainy.<br>

So may I brooke* well mine eyen tway,            *enjoy, possess, or use<br>

Save you, I hearde never man so sing<br>

As did your father in the morrowning.<br>

Certes it was of heart all that he sung.<br>

And, for to make his voice the more strong,<br>

He would *so pain him,* that with both his eyen  *make such an exertion*<br>

He muste wink, so loud he woulde cryen,<br>

And standen on his tiptoes therewithal,<br>

And stretche forth his necke long and small.<br>

And eke he was of such discretion,<br>

That there was no man, in no region,<br>

That him in song or wisdom mighte pass.<br>

I have well read in Dan Burnel the Ass, &lt;29&gt;<br>

Among his verse, how that there was a cock<br>

That, for* a prieste's son gave him a knock                     *because<br>

Upon his leg, while he was young and nice,*                     *foolish<br>

He made him for to lose his benefice.<br>

But certain there is no comparison<br>

Betwixt the wisdom and discretion<br>

Of youre father, and his subtilty.<br>

Now singe, Sir, for sainte charity,<br>

Let see, can ye your father counterfeit?"<br>

The fox answer'd, "In faith it shall be done:"<br>

And, as he spake the word, all suddenly<br>

The cock brake from his mouth deliverly,*                        *nimbly<br>

And high upon a tree he flew anon.<br>

And when the fox saw that the cock was gone,<br>

<p id="id01703" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Nun's Priest's Tale</p>

<p id="id01704" style="margin-top: 2em">1.  The Tale of the Nun's Priest is founded on the fifth chapter
of an old French metrical "Romance of Renard;" the same story
forming one of the fables of Marie, the translator of the Breton
Lays. (See note 2 to the Prologue to the Franklin's Tale.)
Although Dryden was in error when he ascribed the Tale to
Chaucer's own invention, still the materials on which he had to
operate were out of cornparison more trivial than the result.</p>

<p id="id01705">2.  Tyrwhitt quotes two statutes of Edward III, in which "deys"
are included among the servants employed in agricultural
pursuits; the name seems to have originally meant a servant who
gave his labour by the day, but afterwards to have been
appropriated exclusively to one who superintended or worked
in a dairy.</p>

<p id="id01706">3. Orgon: here licentiously used for the plural, "organs" or
"orgons," corresponding to the plural verb "gon" in the next
line.</p>

<p id="id01707">4. Horloge: French, "clock."</p>

<p id="id01708">5. Embattell'd: indented on the upper edge like the battlements
of a castle.</p>

<p id="id01709">6. My lefe is fare in land: This seems to have been the refrain of
some old song, and its precise meaning is uncertain. It
corresponds in cadence with the morning salutation of the cock;
and may be taken as a greeting to the sun, which is beloved of
Chanticleer, and has just come upon the earth — or in the sense
of a more local boast, as vaunting the fairness of his favourite
hen above all others in the country round.</p>

<p id="id01710">Transcriber's note: Later commentators explain "fare in land" as
"gone abroad" and  have identified the song:</p>

<p id="id01711">My lefe is fare in lond<br>

Alas! Why is she so?<br>

And I am so sore bound<br>

I may not come her to.<br>

She hath my heart in hold<br>

Where ever she ride or go<br>

With true love a thousand-fold.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01712">(Printed in The Athenaeum, 1896, Vol II, p. 566).</p>

<p id="id01713">7. "Avoi!" is the word here rendered "away!" It was frequently
used in the French fabliaux, and the Italians employ the word
"via!" in the same sense.</p>

<p id="id01714">8. "Ne do no force of dreams:" "Somnia ne cares;" —  Cato
"De Moribus," 1 ii, dist. 32</p>

<p id="id01715">9. Centaury: the herb so called because by its virtue the centaur
Chiron was healed when the poisoned arrow of Hercules had
accidentally wounded his foot.</p>

<p id="id01716">10. Fumetere: the herb "fumitory."</p>

<p id="id01717">11. Catapuce:  spurge; a plant of purgative qualities. To its
name in the text correspond the Italian "catapuzza," and French
"catapuce" — words the origin of which is connected with the
effects of the plant.</p>

<p id="id01718">12. Gaitre-berries: dog-wood berries.</p>

<p id="id01719">13. One of the greatest authors that men read: Cicero, who in
his book "De Divinatione" tells this and the following story,
though in contrary order and with many differences.</p>

<p id="id01720">14. Haled or hylled; from Anglo-Saxon "helan" hid, concealed</p>

<p id="id01721">15.  Kenelm succeeded his father as king of the Saxon realm of
Mercia in 811, at the age of seven years; but he was slain by his
ambitious aunt Quendrada. The place of his burial was
miraculously discovered, and he was subsequently elevated to
the rank of a saint and martyr. His life is in the English "Golden
Legend."</p>

<p id="id01722">16. Mercenrike: the kingdom of Mercia; Anglo-Saxon,
Myrcnarice. Compare the second member of the compound in
the German, "Frankreich," France; "Oesterreich," Austria.</p>

<p id="id01723">17. Cicero ("De Republica," lib. vi.) wrote the Dream of
Scipio, in which the Younger relates the appearance of the
Elder Africanus, and the counsels and exhortations which the
shade addressed to the sleeper. Macrobius wrote an elaborate
"Commentary on the Dream of Scipio," — a philosophical
treatise much studied and relished during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p id="id01724">18. See the Monk's Tale for this story.</p>

<p id="id01725">19. Andromache's dream will not be found in Homer; It is
related in the book of the fictitious Dares Phrygius, the most
popular authority during the Middle Ages for the history of the
Trojan War.</p>

<p id="id01726">20. In principio: In the beginning; the first words of Genesis and
of the Gospel of John.</p>

<p id="id01727">21. Mulier est hominis confusio:  This line is taken from the
same fabulous conference between the Emperor Adrian and the
philosopher Secundus, whence Chaucer derived some of the
arguments in praise of poverty employed in the Wife of Bath's
Tale proper. See note 14 to the Wife of Bath's tale.  The
passage transferred to the text is the commencement of a
description of woman. "Quid est mulier? hominis confusio," &amp;c.
("What is Woman? A union with man", &amp;c.)</p>

<p id="id01728">22. Col-fox: a blackish fox, so called because of its likeness to
coal, according to Skinner; though more probably the prefix has
a reproachful meaning, and is in some way connected with the
word "cold" as, some forty lines below, it is applied to the
prejudicial counsel of women, and as frequently it is used to
describe "sighs" and other tokens of grief, and "cares" or
"anxieties."</p>

<p id="id01729">23. Undern:  In this case, the meaning of "evening" or
"afternoon" can hardly be applied to the word, which must be
taken to signify some early hour of the forenoon. See also note
4 to the Wife of Bath's tale and note 5 to the Clerk's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01730">24. Ganilion: a traitor.  See note 9 to the Shipman's Tale and
note 28 to the Monk's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01731">25. Greek Sinon: The inventor of the Trojan Horse. See note 14
to the Squire's Tale</p>

<p id="id01732">26. Boult it from the bren: Examine the matter thoroughly; a
metaphor taken from the sifting of meal, to divide the fine flour
from the bran.</p>

<p id="id01733">27. Thomas Bradwardine, Archbishop of Canterbury in the
thirteenth century, who wrote a book, "De Causa Dei," in
controversy with Pelagius; and also numerous other treatises,
among them some  on predestination.</p>

<p id="id01734">28. In a popular mediaveal Latin treatise by one Theobaldus,
entitled "Physiologus de Naturis XII. Animalium" ("A
description of the nature of twelve animals"),  sirens or
mermaids are described as skilled in song, and drawing unwary
mariners to destruction by the sweetness of their voices.</p>

<p id="id01735">29. "Nigellus Wireker," says Urry's Glossary, "a monk and
precentor of Canterbury, wrote a Latin poem intituled
'Speculum Speculorum,' ('The mirror of mirrors') dedicated to
William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, and Lord Chancellor;
wherein, under the fable of an Ass (which he calls 'Burnellus')
that desired a longer tail, is represented the folly of such as are
not content with their own condition. There is introduced a tale
of a cock, who having his leg broke by a priest's son (called
Gundulfus) watched an opportunity to be revenged; which at
last presented itself on this occasion: A day was appointed for
Gundulfus's being admitted into holy orders at a place remote
from his father's habitation; he therefore orders the servants to
call him at first cock-crowing, which the cock overhearing did
not crow at all that morning. So Gundulfus overslept himself,
and was thereby disappointed of his ordination, the office being
quite finished before he came to the place." Wireker's satire was
among the most celebrated and popular Latin poems of the
Middle Ages. The Ass was probably as Tyrwhitt suggests,
called "Burnel" or "Brunel," from his brown colour; as, a little
below, a reddish fox is called "Russel."</p>

<p id="id01736">30. Flattour: flatterer; French, "flatteur."</p>

<p id="id01737">31. Losengeour: deceiver, cozener; the word had analogues in
the French "losengier," and the Spanish "lisongero." It is
probably connected with "leasing," falsehood; which has been
derived from Anglo-Saxon "hlisan," to celebrate — as if it meant
the spreading of a false renown</p>

<p id="id01738">32. Dan Russel: Master Russet; a name given to the fox, from
his reddish colour.</p>

<p id="id01739">33. Geoffrey de Vinsauf was the author of a well-known
mediaeval treatise on composition in various poetical styles of
which he gave examples. Chaucer's irony is therefore directed
against some grandiose and affected lines on the death of
Richard I., intended to illustrate the pathetic style, in which
Friday is addressed as "O Veneris lachrymosa dies" ("O tearful
day of Venus").</p>

<p id="id01740">34. "Priamum altaria ad ipsa trementem
     Traxit, et in multo lapsantem sanguine nati
     Implicuitque comam laeva, dextraque coruscum
     Extulit, ac lateri capulo tenus abdidit ensem.
     Haec finis Priami fatorum."
("He dragged Priam trembling to his own altar, slipping on the
blood of his child; He took his hair in his left hand, and with the
right drew the flashing sword, and hid it to the hilt [in his body].
Thus an end was made of Priam")
— Virgil, Aeneid. ii. 550.</p>

<p id="id01741">35. Jack Straw: The leader of a Kentish rising, in the reign of
Richard II, in 1381, by which the Flemish merchants in London
were great sufferers.</p>

<p id="id01742">36. Beams: trumpets; Anglo-Saxon, "bema."</p>

<p id="id01743">37. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be
perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works." — 2 Tim. iii.

<p id="id01745" style="margin-top: 2em">"Sir Nunne's Priest," our hoste said anon,<br>

"Y-blessed be thy breech, and every stone;<br>

<p id="id01746" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Epilogue to the Nun's Priest's Tale</p>

<p id="id01747" style="margin-top: 2em">1.  The sixteen lines appended to the Tale of the Nun's Priest
seem, as Tyrwhitt observes, to commence the prologue to the
succeeding Tale — but the difficulty is to determine which that
Tale should be. In earlier editions, the lines formed the opening
of the prologue to the Manciple's Tale; but most of the
manuscripts acknowledge themselves defective in this part, and
give the Nun's Tale after that of the Nun's Priest. In the Harleian
manuscript, followed by Mr Wright, the second Nun's Tale, and
the Canon's Yeoman's Tale, are placed after the Franklin's tale;
and the sixteen lines above are not found — the Manciple's
prologue coming immediately after the "Amen" of the Nun's
Priest. In two manuscripts, the last line of the sixteen runs thus:
"Said unto the Nun as ye shall hear;" and six lines more
evidently forged, are given to introduce the Nun's Tale.  All this
confusion and doubt only strengthen the certainty, and deepen
the regret, that "The Canterbury Tales" were left at Chaucer's,
death not merely very imperfect as a whole, but destitute of
many finishing touches that would have made them complete so
far as the conception had actually been carried into
performance.</p>

Be thou mine advocate in that high place,<br>

Where as withouten end is sung Osanne,<br>

Thou Christe's mother, daughter dear of Anne.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01759">And of thy light my soul in prison light,<br>

That troubled is by the contagion<br>

Of my body, and also by the weight<br>

Of earthly lust and false affection;<br>

O hav'n of refuge, O salvation<br>

Of them that be in sorrow and distress,<br>

Now help, for to my work I will me dress.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01760">Yet pray I you, that reade what I write, &lt;6&gt;<br>

Forgive me that I do no diligence<br>

This ilke* story subtilly t' indite.                               *same<br>

For both have I the wordes and sentence<br>

Of him that at the sainte's reverence<br>

The story wrote, and follow her legend;<br>

And pray you that you will my work amend.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01761">First will I you the name of Saint Cecilie<br>

Expound, as men may in her story see.<br>

It is to say in English, Heaven's lily,&lt;7&gt;<br>

For pure chasteness of virginity;<br>

Or, for she whiteness had of honesty,*                           *purity<br>

And green of conscience, and of good fame<br>

The sweete savour, Lilie was her name.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01762">Or Cecilie is to say, the way of blind;&lt;7&gt;<br>

For she example was by good teaching;<br>

Or else Cecilie, as I written find,<br>

Is joined by a manner conjoining<br>

Of heaven and Lia, &lt;7&gt; and herein figuring<br>

The heaven is set for thought of holiness,<br>

And Lia for her lasting business.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01763">Cecilie may eke be said in this mannere,<br>

Wanting of blindness, for her greate light<br>

Of sapience, and for her thewes* clear.                       *qualities<br>

Or elles, lo, this maiden's name bright<br>

Of heaven and Leos &lt;7&gt; comes, for which by right<br>

Men might her well the heaven of people call,<br>

Example of good and wise workes all;<br>
</p>

<p id="id01764">For Leos people in English is to say;<br>

And right as men may in the heaven see<br>

The sun and moon, and starres every way,<br>

Right so men ghostly,* in this maiden free,                 *spiritually<br>

Sawen of faith the magnanimity,<br>

And eke the clearness whole of sapience,<br>

And sundry workes bright of excellence.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01765">And right so as these philosophers write,<br>

That heav'n is swift and round, and eke burning,<br>

Right so was faire Cecilie the white<br>

Full swift and busy in every good working,<br>

And round and whole in good persevering, &lt;8&gt;<br>

And burning ever in charity full bright;<br>

Now have I you declared *what she hight.*         *why she had her name*<br>
</p>

<p id="id01766">This maiden bright Cecile, as her life saith,<br>

Was come of Romans, and of noble kind,<br>

And from her cradle foster'd in the faith<br>

Of Christ, and bare his Gospel in her mind:<br>

She never ceased, as I written find,<br>

Of her prayere, and God to love and dread,<br>

Beseeching him to keep her maidenhead.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01767">And when this maiden should unto a man<br>

Y-wedded be, that was full young of age,<br>

Which that y-called was Valerian,<br>

And come was the day of marriage,<br>

She, full devout and humble in her corage,*                       *heart<br>

Under her robe of gold, that sat full fair,<br>

Had next her flesh y-clad her in an hair.*        *garment of hair-cloth<br>
</p>

<p id="id01768">And while the organs made melody,<br>

To God alone thus in her heart sang she;<br>

"O Lord, my soul and eke my body gie*                             *guide<br>

Unwemmed,* lest that I confounded be."                      *unblemished<br>

And, for his love that died upon the tree,<br>

Every second or third day she fast',<br>

Aye bidding* in her orisons full fast.                          *praying<br>
</p>

<p id="id01769">The night came, and to bedde must she gon<br>

With her husband, as it is the mannere;<br>

And privily she said to him anon;<br>

"O sweet and well-beloved spouse dear,<br>

There is a counsel,* an'** ye will it hear,                 *secret **if<br>

Which that right fain I would unto you say,<br>

So that ye swear ye will it not bewray."*                        *betray<br>
</p>

<p id="id01770">Valerian gan fast unto her swear<br>

That for no case nor thing that mighte be,<br>

He never should to none bewrayen her;<br>

And then at erst* thus to him saide she;             *for the first time<br>

"I have an angel which that loveth me,<br>

That with great love, whether I wake or sleep,<br>

Is ready aye my body for to keep;<br>
</p>

<p id="id01771">"And if that he may feelen, *out of dread,*              *without doubt*<br>

That ye me touch or love in villainy,<br>

He right anon will slay you with the deed,<br>

And in your youthe thus ye shoulde die.<br>

And if that ye in cleane love me gie,"*                           *guide<br>

He will you love as me, for your cleanness,<br>

And shew to you his joy and his brightness."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01772">Valerian, corrected as God wo'ld,<br>

Answer'd again, "If I shall truste thee,<br>

Let me that angel see, and him behold;<br>

And if that it a very angel be,<br>

Then will I do as thou hast prayed me;<br>

And if thou love another man, forsooth<br>

Right with this sword then will I slay you both."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01773">Cecile answer'd anon right in this wise;<br>

"If that you list, the angel shall ye see,<br>

So that ye trow* Of Christ, and you baptise;                       *know<br>

Go forth to Via Appia," quoth she,<br>

That from this towne stands but miles three,<br>

And to the poore folkes that there dwell<br>

Say them right thus, as that I shall you tell,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01774">"Tell them, that I, Cecile, you to them sent<br>

To shewe you the good Urban the old,<br>

For secret needes,* and for good intent;                       *business<br>

And when that ye Saint Urban have behold,<br>

Tell him the wordes which I to you told<br>

And when that he hath purged you from sin,<br>

Then shall ye see that angel ere ye twin*                        *depart<br>
</p>

<p id="id01775">Valerian is to the place gone;<br>

And, right as he was taught by her learning<br>

He found this holy old Urban anon<br>

Among the saintes' burials louting;*                *lying concealed &lt;9&gt;<br>

And he anon, withoute tarrying,<br>

Did his message, and when that he it told,<br>

Urban for joy his handes gan uphold.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01776">The teares from his eyen let he fall;<br>

"Almighty Lord, O Jesus Christ,"<br>

Quoth he, "Sower of chaste counsel, herd* of us all;           *shepherd<br>

The fruit of thilke* seed of chastity                              *that<br>

That thou hast sown in Cecile, take to thee<br>

Lo, like a busy bee, withoute guile,<br>

Thee serveth aye thine owen thrall* Cicile,                     *servant<br>
</p>

<p id="id01777">"For thilke spouse, that she took *but now,*                    *lately*<br>

Full like a fierce lion, she sendeth here,<br>

As meek as e'er was any lamb to owe."<br>

And with that word anon there gan appear<br>

An old man, clad in white clothes clear,<br>

That had a book with letters of gold in hand,<br>

And gan before Valerian to stand.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01778">Valerian, as dead, fell down for dread,<br>

When he him saw; and he up hent* him tho,**                *took **there<br>

And on his book right thus he gan to read;<br>

"One Lord, one faith, one God withoute mo',<br>

One Christendom, one Father of all also,<br>

Aboven all, and over all everywhere."<br>

These wordes all with gold y-written were.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01779">When this was read, then said this olde man,<br>

"Believ'st thou this or no? say yea or nay."<br>

"I believe all this," quoth Valerian,<br>

"For soother* thing than this, I dare well say,                   *truer<br>

Under the Heaven no wight thinke may."<br>

Then vanish'd the old man, he wist not where<br>

And Pope Urban him christened right there.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01780">Valerian went home, and found Cecilie<br>

Within his chamber with an angel stand;<br>

This angel had of roses and of lily<br>

Corones* two, the which he bare in hand,                         *crowns<br>

And first to Cecile, as I understand,<br>

He gave the one, and after gan he take<br>

The other to Valerian her make.*                          *mate, husband<br>
</p>

<p id="id01781">"With body clean, and with unwemmed* thought,      *unspotted, blameless<br>

Keep aye well these corones two," quoth he;<br>

"From Paradise to you I have them brought,<br>

Nor ever more shall they rotten be,<br>

Nor lose their sweet savour, truste me,<br>

Nor ever wight shall see them with his eye,<br>

But he be chaste, and hate villainy.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01782">"And thou, Valerian, for thou so soon<br>

Assented hast to good counsel, also<br>

Say what thee list,* and thou shalt have thy boon."**     *wish **desire<br>

"I have a brother," quoth Valerian tho,*                           *then<br>

"That in this world I love no man so;<br>

I pray you that my brother may have grace<br>

To know the truth, as I do in this place."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01783">The angel said, "God liketh thy request,<br>

And bothe, with the palm of martyrdom,<br>

Ye shalle come unto this blissful rest."<br>

And, with that word, Tiburce his brother came.<br>

And when that he the savour undernome*                        *perceived<br>

Which that the roses and the lilies cast,<br>

Within his heart he gan to wonder fast;<br>
</p>

<p id="id01784">And said; "I wonder, this time of the year,<br>

Whence that sweete savour cometh so<br>

Of rose and lilies, that I smelle here;<br>

For though I had them in mine handes two,<br>

The savour might in me no deeper go;<br>

The sweete smell, that in my heart I find,<br>

Hath changed me all in another kind."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01785">Valerian said, "Two crownes here have we,<br>

Snow-white and rose-red, that shine clear,<br>

Which that thine eyen have no might to see;<br>

And, as thou smellest them through my prayere,<br>

So shalt thou see them, leve* brother dear,                     *beloved<br>

If it so be thou wilt withoute sloth<br>

Believe aright, and know the very troth. "<br>
</p>

<p id="id01786">Tiburce answered, "Say'st thou this to me<br>

In soothness, or in dreame hear I this?"<br>

"In dreames," quoth Valorian, "have we be<br>

Unto this time, brother mine, y-wis<br>

But now *at erst* in truth our dwelling is."        *for the first time*<br>

How know'st thou this," quoth Tiburce; "in what wise?"<br>

Quoth Valerian, "That shall I thee devise*                     *describe<br>
</p>

<p id="id01787">"The angel of God hath me the truth y-taught,<br>

Which thou shalt see, if that thou wilt reny*                  *renounce<br>

The idols, and be clean, and elles nought."<br>

[And of the miracle of these crownes tway<br>

Saint Ambrose in his preface list to say;<br>

Solemnely this noble doctor dear<br>

Commendeth it, and saith in this mannere<br>
</p>

<p id="id01788">"The palm of martyrdom for to receive,<br>

Saint Cecilie, full filled of God's gift,<br>

The world and eke her chamber gan to weive;*                    *forsake<br>

Witness Tiburce's and Cecilie's shrift,*                     *confession<br>

To which God of his bounty woulde shift<br>

Corones two, of flowers well smelling,<br>

And made his angel them the crownes bring.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01789">"The maid hath brought these men to bliss above;<br>

The world hath wist what it is worth, certain,<br>

Devotion of chastity to love."] &lt;10&gt;<br>

Then showed him Cecilie all open and plain,<br>

That idols all are but a thing in vain,<br>

For they be dumb, and thereto* they be deave;**        *therefore **deaf<br>

And charged him his idols for to leave.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01790">"Whoso that troweth* not this, a beast he is,"                *believeth<br>

Quoth this Tiburce, "if that I shall not lie."<br>

And she gan kiss his breast when she heard this,<br>

And was full glad he could the truth espy:<br>

"This day I take thee for mine ally."*                    *chosen friend<br>

Saide this blissful faire maiden dear;<br>

And after that she said as ye may hear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01791">"Lo, right so as the love of Christ," quoth she,<br>

"Made me thy brother's wife, right in that wise<br>

Anon for mine ally here take I thee,<br>

Since that thou wilt thine idoles despise.<br>

Go with thy brother now and thee baptise,<br>

And make thee clean, so that thou may'st behold<br>

The angel's face, of which thy brother told."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01792">Tiburce answer'd, and saide, "Brother dear,<br>

First tell me whither I shall, and to what man?"<br>

"To whom?" quoth he, "come forth with goode cheer,<br>

I will thee lead unto the Pope Urban."<br>

"To Urban? brother mine Valerian,"<br>

Quoth then Tiburce; "wilt thou me thither lead?<br>

Me thinketh that it were a wondrous deed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01793">"Meanest thou not that Urban," quoth he tho,*                      *then<br>

"That is so often damned to be dead,<br>

And wons* in halkes** always to and fro,               *dwells **corners<br>

And dare not ones putte forth his head?<br>

Men should him brennen* in a fire so red,                          *burn<br>

If he were found, or if men might him spy:<br>

And us also, to bear him company.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01794">"And while we seeke that Divinity<br>

That is y-hid in heaven privily,<br>

Algate* burnt in this world should we be."                 *nevertheless<br>

To whom Cecilie answer'd boldely;<br>

"Men mighte dreade well and skilfully*                       *reasonably<br>

This life to lose, mine owen deare brother,<br>

That there is other life where men may won."*                     *dwell<br>

To whom answer'd Tiburce, "O sister dear,<br>

Saidest thou not right now in this mannere,<br>

There was but one God, Lord in soothfastness,*                    *truth<br>

And now of three how may'st thou bear witness?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id01796">"That shall I tell," quoth she, "ere that I go.<br>

Right as a man hath sapiences* three,                  *mental faculties<br>

Then gan she him full busily to preach<br>

Of Christe's coming, and his paines teach,<br>

<p id="id01797">And many pointes of his passion;<br>

How Godde's Son in this world was withhold*                    *employed<br>

With Valerian to Pope Urban he went.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01798">That thanked God, and with glad heart and light<br>

He christen'd him, and made him in that place<br>

Perfect in his learning, and Godde's knight.<br>

That every day he saw in time and space<br>

Th' angel of God, and every manner boon*                *request, favour<br>

<p id="id01799">It were full hard by order for to sayn<br>

How many wonders Jesus for them wrought,<br>

But at the last, to telle short and plain,<br>

The sergeants of the town of Rome them sought,<br>

And them before Almach the Prefect brought,<br>

Which them apposed,* and knew all their intent,              *questioned<br>

<p id="id01806">Cecile him took, and buried him anon<br>

By Tiburce and Valerian softely,<br>

Within their burying-place, under the stone.<br>

And after this Almachius hastily<br>

Bade his ministers fetchen openly<br>

Cecile, so that she might in his presence<br>

Do sacrifice, and Jupiter incense.*                     *burn incense to<br>

<p id="id01807">But they, converted at her wise lore,*                         *teaching<br>

Wepte full sore, and gave full credence<br>

Unto her word, and cried more and more;<br>

"Christ, Godde's Son, withoute difference,<br>

<p id="id01808">Almachius, that heard of this doing,<br>

Bade fetch Cecilie, that he might her see;<br>

And alderfirst,* lo, this was his asking;                  *first of all<br>

"What manner woman arte thou?" quoth he,<br>

"I am a gentle woman born," quoth she.<br>

"I aske thee," quoth he,"though it thee grieve,<br>

Of thy religion and of thy believe."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01809">"Ye have begun your question foolishly,"<br>

Quoth she, "that wouldest two answers conclude<br>

In one demand? ye aske lewedly."*                            *ignorantly<br>

Almach answer'd to that similitude,<br>

"Of whence comes thine answering so rude?"<br>

"Of whence?" quoth she, when that she was freined,*               *asked<br>

"Of conscience, and of good faith unfeigned."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01810">Almachius saide; "Takest thou no heed<br>

Of my power?" and she him answer'd this;<br>

"Your might," quoth she, "full little is to dread;<br>

For every mortal manne's power is<br>

But like a bladder full of wind, y-wis;*                      *certainly<br>

For with a needle's point, when it is blow',<br>

May all the boast of it be laid full low."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01811">"Full wrongfully begunnest thou," quoth he,<br>

"And yet in wrong is thy perseverance.<br>

Know'st thou not how our mighty princes free<br>

Have thus commanded and made ordinance,<br>

That every Christian wight shall have penance,*              *punishment<br>

But if that he his Christendom withsay,*                           *deny<br>

<p id="id01812">"Your princes erren, as your nobley* doth,"                    *nobility<br>

Quoth then Cecile, "and with a *wood sentence*            *mad judgment*<br>

Ye make us guilty, and it is not sooth:*                           *true<br>

For ye that knowe well our innocence,<br>

Forasmuch as we do aye reverence<br>

To Christ, and for we bear a Christian name,<br>

Ye put on us a crime and eke a blame.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01813">"But we that knowe thilke name so<br>

For virtuous, we may it not withsay."<br>

Almach answered, "Choose one of these two,<br>

Do sacrifice, or Christendom renay,<br>

That thou may'st now escape by that way."<br>

At which the holy blissful faire maid<br>

Gan for to laugh, and to the judge said;<br>

<p id="id01814">"O judge, *confused in thy nicety,*            *confounded in thy folly*<br>

Wouldest thou that I reny innocence?<br>

To make me a wicked wight," quoth she,<br>

"Lo, he dissimuleth* here in audience;                       *dissembles<br>

He stareth and woodeth* in his advertence."**   *grows furious **thought<br>

To whom Almachius said, "Unsely* wretch,                        *unhappy<br>

</p>

<p id="id01815">"Have not our mighty princes to me given<br>

Yea bothe power and eke authority<br>

To make folk to dien or to liven?<br>

Why speakest thou so proudly then to me?"<br>

"I speake not but steadfastly," quoth she,<br>

Not proudly, for I say, as for my side,<br>

We hate deadly* thilke vice of pride.                          *mortally<br>

Thou hast none other power nor no leave.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01817">"But thou may'st say, thy princes have thee maked<br>

Minister of death; for if thou speak of mo',<br>

Thou liest; for thy power is full naked."<br>

"Do away thy boldness," said Almachius tho,*                       *then<br>

"And sacrifice to our gods, ere thou go.<br>

I recke not what wrong that thou me proffer,<br>

For I can suffer it as a philosopher.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01818">"But those wronges may I not endure,<br>

That thou speak'st of our goddes here," quoth he.<br>

Cecile answer'd, "O nice* creature,                             *foolish<br>

<p id="id01827" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Nun's Priest's Tale</p>

<p id="id01828" style="margin-top: 2em">1.  This Tale was originally composed by Chaucer as a separate
work, and as such it is mentioned in the "Legend of Good
Women" under the title of "The Life of Saint Cecile".  Tyrwhitt
quotes the line in which the author calls himself an "unworthy
son of Eve," and that in which he says, "Yet pray I you, that
reade what I write", as internal evidence that the insertion of the
poem in the Canterbury Tales was the result of an afterthought;
while the whole tenor of the introduction confirms the belief
that Chaucer composed it as a writer or translator — not,
dramatically, as a speaker. The story is almost literally
translated from the Life of St Cecilia in the "Legenda Aurea."</p>

<p id="id01829">2. Leas: leash, snare; the same as "las," oftener used by
Chaucer.</p>

<p id="id01830">3. The nativity and assumption of the Virgin Mary formed the
themes of some of St Bernard's most eloquent sermons.</p>

<p id="id01831">4. Compare with this stanza the fourth stanza of the Prioress's
Tale, the substance of which is the same.</p>

<p id="id01832">5. "But he answered and said, it is not meet to take the
children's bread, and cast it to dogs.  And she said, Truth, Lord:
yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's
table." —  Matthew xv. 26, 27.</p>

<p id="id01833">6.  See note 1.</p>

<p id="id01834">7. These are Latin puns: Heaven's lily - "Coeli lilium"; The way
of blind - "Caeci via";  Heaven and Lia - from "Coeli", heaven,
and "Ligo," to bind; Heaven and Leos - from Coeli and "Laos,"
(Ionian Greek) or "Leos" (Attic Greek), the people. Such
punning derivations of proper names were very much in favour
in the Middle Ages. The explanations of St Cecilia's name are
literally taken from the prologue to the Latin legend.</p>

<p id="id01835">8. This passage suggests Horace's description of the wise man,
who, among other things, is "in se ipse totus, teres, atque
rotundus." ("complete in himself, polished and rounded") —
Satires, 2, vii. 80.</p>

<p id="id01836">9. Louting: lingering, or lying concealed; the Latin original has
"Inter sepulchra martyrum latiantem" ("hiding among the tombs
of martyrs")</p>

<p id="id01837">10.  The fourteen lines within brackets are supposed to have
been originally an interpolation in the Latin legend, from which
they are literally translated. They awkwardly interrupt the flow
of the narration.</p>

<p id="id01838">11. Engine: wit; the devising or constructive faculty; Latin,
"ingenium."</p>

<p id="id01839">12. Cold: wretched, distressful; see note 22 to the Nun's Priest's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id01840">13. Corniculere:  The secretary or registrar who was charged
with publishing the acts, decrees and orders of the prefect.</p>

<p id="id01841">14. "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown
of righteousness" — 2 Tim. iv. 7, 8.</p>

<p id="id01842">15. Did him to-beat:  Caused him to be cruelly or fatally beaten;
the force of the "to" is intensive.</p>

Ere we had ridden fully five mile, &lt;2&gt;<br>

At Boughton-under-Blee us gan o'ertake<br>

A man, that clothed was in clothes black,<br>

And underneath he wore a white surplice.<br>

His hackenay,* which was all pomely-gris,**           *nag **dapple-gray<br>

So sweated, that it wonder was to see;<br>

It seem'd as he had pricked* miles three.                       *spurred<br>

The horse eke that his yeoman rode upon<br>

So sweated, that unnethes* might he gon.**                  *hardly **go<br>

About the peytrel &lt;3&gt; stood the foam full high;<br>

He was of foam, as *flecked as a pie.*           *spotted like a magpie*<br>

A maile twyfold &lt;4&gt; on his crupper lay;<br>

It seemed that he carried little array;<br>

All light for summer rode this worthy man.<br>

And in my heart to wonder I began<br>

What that he was, till that I understood<br>

How that his cloak was sewed to his hood;<br>

For which, when I had long advised* me,                      *considered<br>

I deemed him some Canon for to be.<br>

His hat hung at his back down by a lace,*                          *cord<br>

For he had ridden more than trot or pace;<br>

He hadde pricked like as he were wood.*                             *mad<br>

A clote-leaf* he had laid  under his hood,                * burdock-leaf<br>

For sweat, and for to keep his head from heat.<br>

But it was joye for to see him sweat;<br>

His forehead dropped as a stillatory*                             *still<br>

Were full of plantain or of paritory.*                       *wallflower<br>

And when that he was come, he gan to cry,<br>

"God save," quoth he, "this jolly company.<br>

Fast have I pricked," quoth he, "for your sake,<br>

Because that I would you overtake,<br>

To riden in this merry company."<br>

His Yeoman was eke full of courtesy,<br>

And saide, "Sirs, now in the morning tide<br>

Out of your hostelry I saw you ride,<br>

And warned here my lord and sovereign,<br>

Which that to ride with you is full fain,<br>

For his disport; he loveth dalliance."<br>

"Friend, for thy warning God give thee good chance,"*           *fortune<br>

Said oure Host; "certain it woulde seem<br>

Thy lord were wise, and so I may well deem;<br>

He is full jocund also, dare I lay;<br>

Can he aught tell a merry tale or tway,<br>

With which he gladden may this company?"<br>

"Who, Sir? my lord? Yea, Sir, withoute lie,<br>

I warn you well, he is a passing* man."       *surpassing, extraordinary<br>

Well," quoth our Host, "I pray thee tell me than,<br>

Is he a clerk,* or no? Tell what he is."                *scholar, priest<br>

"Nay, he is greater than a clerk, y-wis,"*                    *certainly<br>

Saide this Yeoman; "and, in wordes few,<br>

Host, of his craft somewhat I will you shew,<br>

I say, my lord can* such a subtlety                               *knows<br>

That all the ground on which we be riding<br>

Till that we come to Canterbury town,<br>

He could all cleane turnen up so down,<br>

And pave it all of silver and of gold."<br>

And when this Yeoman had this tale told<br>

Unto our Host, he said; "Ben'dicite!<br>

This thing is wonder marvellous to me,<br>

Since that thy lord is of so high prudence,<br>

Because of which men should him reverence,<br>

That of a pounde we can make tway.<br>

Yet is it false; and aye we have good hope<br>

It for to do, and after it we grope:*                    *search, strive<br>

But that science is so far us beforn,<br>

That we may not, although we had it sworn,<br>

It overtake, it slides away so fast;<br>

It will us make beggars at the last."<br>

While this Yeoman was thus in his talking,<br>

This Canon drew him near, and heard all thing<br>

Which this Yeoman spake, for suspicion<br>

Of menne's speech ever had this Canon:<br>

For Cato saith, that he that guilty is, &lt;6&gt;<br>

Deemeth all things be spoken of him y-wis;*                      *surely<br>

Because of that he gan so nigh to draw<br>

To his Yeoman, that he heard all his saw;<br>

And thus he said unto his Yeoman tho*                              *then<br>

"Hold thou thy peace,and speak no wordes mo':<br>

For if thou do, thou shalt *it dear abie.*           *pay dearly for it*<br>

Thou slanderest me here in this company<br>

And eke discoverest that thou shouldest hide."<br>

"Yea," quoth our Host, "tell on, whatso betide;<br>

Of all his threatening reck not a mite."<br>

"In faith," quoth he, "no more do I but lite."*                  *little<br>

And when this Canon saw it would not be<br>

But his Yeoman would tell his privity,*                         *secrets<br>

He fled away for very sorrow and shame.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01848">"Ah!" quoth the Yeoman, "here shall rise a game;*        *some diversion<br>

All that I can anon I will you tell,<br>

Since he is gone; the foule fiend him quell!*                   *destroy<br>

For ne'er hereafter will I with him meet,<br>

For penny nor for pound, I you behete.*                         *promise<br>

He that me broughte first unto that game,<br>

Ere that he die, sorrow have he and shame.<br>

For it is earnest* to me, by my faith;                 *a serious matter<br>

That feel I well, what so any man saith;<br>

And yet for all my smart, and all my grief,<br>

For all my sorrow, labour, and mischief,*                       *trouble<br>

I coulde never leave it in no wise.<br>

Now would to God my witte might suffice<br>

To tellen all that longeth to that art!<br>

But natheless yet will I telle part;<br>

Since that my lord is gone, I will not spare;<br>

Such thing as that I know, I will declare."<br>

<p id="id01849" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Canon's Yeoman's Tale</p>

<p id="id01850" style="margin-top: 2em">1. "The introduction," says Tyrwhitt, "of the Canon's
Yeoman to tell a Tale at a time when so many of the original
characters remain to be called upon, appears a little
extraordinary. It should seem that some sudden resentment
had determined Chaucer to interrupt the regular course of his
work, in order to insert a satire against the alchemists. That
their pretended science was much cultivated about this time,
and produced its usual evils, may fairly be inferred from the
Act, which was passed soon after, 5 H. IV. c. iv., to make it
felony 'to multiply gold or silver, or to use the art of
multiplication.'" Tyrwhitt finds in the prologue some colour
for the hypothesis that this Tale was intended by Chaucer to
begin the return journey from Canterbury; but against this
must be set the fact that the Yeoman himself expressly speaks
of the distance to Canterbury yet to be ridden.</p>

<p id="id01856" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE. &lt;1&gt;</p>

<p id="id01857" style="margin-top: 2em">With this Canon I dwelt have seven year,<br>

And of his science am I ne'er the near*                          *nearer<br>

All that I had I have lost thereby,<br>

And, God wot, so have many more than I.<br>

Where I was wont to be right fresh and gay<br>

Of clothing, and of other good array<br>

Now may I wear an hose upon mine head;<br>

And where my colour was both fresh and red,<br>

Now is it wan, and of a leaden hue<br>

(Whoso it useth, sore shall he it rue);<br>

And of my swink* yet bleared is mine eye;                        *labour<br>

Lo what advantage is to multiply!<br>

That sliding* science hath me made so bare,         *slippery, deceptive<br>

That I have no good,* where that ever I fare;                  *property<br>

And yet I am indebted so thereby<br>

Of gold, that I have borrow'd truely,<br>

That, while I live, I shall it quite* never;                      *repay<br>

Let every man beware by me for ever.<br>

What manner man that casteth* him thereto,                     *betaketh<br>

If he continue, I hold *his thrift y-do;*         *prosperity at an end*<br>

So help me God, thereby shall he not win,<br>

But empty his purse, and make his wittes thin.<br>

And when he, through his madness and folly,<br>

Hath lost his owen good through jupartie,*                   *hazard &lt;2&gt;<br>

Then he exciteth other men thereto,<br>

To lose their good as he himself hath do'.<br>

For unto shrewes* joy it is and ease                        *wicked folk<br>

To have their fellows in pain and disease.*                     *trouble<br>

Thus was I ones learned of a clerk;<br>

Of that no charge;* I will speak of our work.                    *matter<br>

<p id="id01858">When we be there as we shall exercise<br>

Our elvish* craft, we seeme wonder wise,              *fantastic, wicked<br>

Why should I tellen each proportion<br>

Of thinges, whiche that we work upon,<br>

As on five or six ounces, may well be,<br>

Of silver, or some other quantity?<br>

And busy me to telle you the names,<br>

As orpiment, burnt bones, iron squames,*                     *scales &lt;3&gt;<br>

That into powder grounden be full small?<br>

And in an earthen pot how put is all,<br>

And, salt y-put in, and also peppere,<br>

Before these powders that I speak of here,<br>

And well y-cover'd with a lamp of glass?<br>

Not helpeth us, our labour is in vain.<br>

Nor neither our spirits' ascensioun,<br>

May in our working nothing us avail;<br>

For lost is all our labour and travail,<br>

Is lost also, which we upon it lay.<br>

<p id="id01859">There is also full many another thing<br>

Ne deeme not that I slander your house,<br>

That amonges Christe's apostles twelve<br>

There was no traitor but Judas himselve;<br>

Then why should all the remenant have blame,<br>

That guiltless were? By you I say the same.<br>

<p id="id01865">In London was a priest, an annualere, &lt;12&gt;<br>

That therein dwelled hadde many a year,<br>

Which was so pleasant and so serviceable<br>

Unto the wife, where as he was at table,<br>

That she would suffer him no thing to pay<br>

For board nor clothing, went he ne'er so gay;<br>

And spending silver had he right enow;<br>

Thereof no force;* will proceed as now,                       *no matter<br>

This false canon came upon a day<br>

Unto the prieste's chamber, where he lay,<br>

Beseeching him to lend him a certain<br>

Of gold, and he would quit it him again.<br>

"Lend me a mark," quoth he, "but dayes three,<br>

And at my day I will it quite thee.<br>

And if it so be that thou find me false,<br>

Another day hang me up by the halse."*                             *neck<br>

And this canon him thanked often sithe,*                          *times<br>

And took his leave, and wente forth his way;<br>

And at the thirde day brought his money;<br>

And to the priest he took his gold again,<br>

Whereof this priest was wondrous glad and fain.*                *pleased<br>

"Certes," quoth he, *"nothing annoyeth me*           *I am not unwiling*<br>

To lend a man a noble, or two, or three,<br>

Or what thing were in my possession,<br>

When he so true is of condition,<br>

That in no wise he breake will his day;<br>

To such a man I never can say nay."<br>

"What," quoth this canon, "should I be untrue?<br>

Nay, that were *thing y-fallen all of new!*      *a new thing to happen*<br>

Truth is a thing that I will ever keep,<br>

Unto the day in which that I shall creep<br>

"Yea," quoth the priest; "yea, Sir, and will ye so?<br>

Mary! thereof I pray you heartily."<br>

"At your commandement, Sir, truely,"<br>

Quoth the canon, "and elles God forbid."<br>

Look what there is; "Put in thine hand and grope;<br>

There shalt thou finde silver, as I hope."<br>

What, devil of helle! should it elles be?<br>

Shaving of silver, silver is, pardie.<br>

He put his hand in, and took up a teine<br>

Of silver fine; and glad in every vein<br>

Was this priest, when he saw that it was so.<br>

To fire and hammer; might no man say nay,<br>

But that they weren as they ought to be.<br>

This sotted* priest, who gladder was than he?          *stupid, besotted<br>

Was never bird gladder against the day;<br>

Nor nightingale in the season of May<br>

Was never none, that better list to sing;<br>

Nor lady lustier in carolling,<br>

Or for to speak of love and womanhead;<br>

Nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed,<br>

To standen in grace of his lady dear,<br>

Than had this priest this crafte for to lear;<br>

And to the canon thus he spake and said;<br>

"For love of God, that for us alle died,<br>

And as I may deserve it unto you,<br>

What shall this receipt coste? tell me now."<br>

"By our Lady," quoth this canon, "it is dear.<br>

I warn you well, that, save I and a frere,<br>

In Engleland there can no man it make."<br>

*"No force,"* quoth he; "now, Sir, for Godde's sake,          *no matter<br>

What shall I pay? telle me, I you pray."<br>

"Y-wis,"* quoth he, "it is full dear, I say.                  *certainly<br>

Sir, at one word, if that you list it have,<br>

Ye shall pay forty pound, so God me save;<br>

And n'ere* the friendship that ye did ere this          *were it not for<br>

This priest the sum of forty pound anon<br>

Of nobles fet,* and took them every one                         *fetched<br>

To this canon, for this ilke receipt.<br>

All his working was but fraud and deceit.<br>

"Sir Priest," he said, "I keep* to have no los**     *care **praise &lt;16&gt;<br>

Of my craft, for I would it were kept close;<br>

And as ye love me, keep it secre:<br>

For if men knewen all my subtlety,<br>

By God, they woulde have so great envy<br>

To me, because of my philosophy,<br>

I should be dead, there were no other way."<br>

"God it forbid," quoth the priest, "what ye say.<br>

Yet had I lever* spenden all the good                            *rather<br>

Which that I have (and elles were I wood*),                         *mad<br>

He went his way, and never the priest him sey *                     *saw<br>

After that day; and when that this priest should<br>

Maken assay, at such time as he would,<br>

Of this receipt, farewell! it would not be.<br>

Lo, thus bejaped* and beguil'd was he;                          *tricked<br>

Thus made he his introduction<br>

To bringe folk to their destruction.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01873">Consider, Sirs, how that in each estate<br>

That in good faith I trowe that it be<br>

The cause greatest of such scarcity.<br>

These philosophers speak so mistily<br>

In this craft, that men cannot come thereby,<br>

For any wit that men have how-a-days.<br>

They may well chatter, as do these jays,<br>

And in their termes set their *lust and pain,*   *pleasure and exertion*<br>

But to their purpose shall they ne'er attain.<br>

A man may lightly* learn, if he have aught,                      *easily<br>

He is as bold to run against a stone,<br>

As for to go beside it in the way:<br>

So fare ye that multiply, I say.<br>

If that your eyen cannot see aright,<br>

Look that your minde lacke not his sight.<br>

For though you look never so broad, and stare,<br>

What philosophers say in this mattere.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01874">Lo, thus saith Arnold of the newe town, &lt;18&gt;<br>

As his Rosary maketh mentioun,<br>

He saith right thus, withouten any lie;<br>

"There may no man mercury mortify,&lt;13&gt;<br>

But* it be with his brother's knowledging."                      *except<br>

Lo, how that he, which firste said this thing,<br>

Of philosophers father was, Hermes;&lt;19&gt;<br>

He saith, how that the dragon doubteless<br>

He dieth not, but if that he be slain<br>

With his brother. And this is for to sayn,<br>

By the dragon, Mercury, and none other,<br>

He understood, and Brimstone by his brother,<br>

That out of Sol and Luna were y-draw.*                   *drawn, derived<br>

"And therefore," said he, "take heed to my saw.                  *saying<br>

Let no man busy him this art to seech,*                  *study, explore<br>

*But if* that he th'intention and speech                         *unless<br>

Of philosophers understande can;<br>

And if he do, he is a lewed* man.                     *ignorant, foolish<br>

For this science and this conning,"* quoth he,                *knowledge<br>

"Is of the secret of secrets &lt;20&gt; pardie."<br>

Also there was a disciple of Plato,<br>

That on a time said his master to,<br>

As his book, Senior, &lt;21&gt; will bear witness,<br>

And this was his demand in soothfastness:<br>

"Tell me the name of thilke* privy** stone."              *that **secret<br>

And Plato answer'd unto him anon;<br>

"Take the stone that Titanos men name."<br>

"Which is that?" quoth he. "Magnesia is the same,"<br>

Saide Plato. "Yea, Sir, and is it thus?<br>

This is ignotum per ignotius. &lt;22&gt;<br>

What is Magnesia, good Sir, I pray?"<br>

"It is a water that is made, I say,<br>

Of th' elementes foure," quoth Plato.<br>

"Tell me the roote, good Sir," quoth he tho,*                      *then<br>

"Of that water, if that it be your will."<br>

"Nay, nay," quoth Plato, "certain that I n'ill.*               *will not<br>

The philosophers sworn were every one,<br>

That they should not discover it to none,<br>

Nor in no book it write in no mannere;<br>

For unto God it is so lefe* and dear,                          *precious<br>

That he will not that it discover'd be,<br>

</p>

<p id="id01875">Then thus conclude I, since that God of heaven<br>

Of his will, certes never shall he thrive,<br>

Though that he multiply term of his live. &lt;23&gt;<br>

And there a point;* for ended is my tale.                           *end<br>

<p id="id01876" style="margin-top: 2em">Note to the Canon's Yeoman's Tale</p>

<p id="id01877" style="margin-top: 2em">1.  The Tale of the Canon's Yeoman, like those of the Wife of
Bath and the Pardoner, is made up of two parts; a long
general introduction, and the story proper. In the case of the
Wife of Bath, the interruptions of other pilgrims, and the
autobiographical nature of the discourse, recommend the
separation of the prologue from the Tale proper; but in the
other cases the introductory or merely connecting matter
ceases wholly where the opening of "The Tale" has been
marked in the text.</p>

<p id="id01878">2. Jupartie: Jeopardy, hazard.  In Froissart's French, "a jeu
partie" is used to signify a game or contest in which the
chances were exactly equal for both sides.</p>

<p id="id01879">3. Squames: Scales; Latin, "squamae."</p>

<p id="id01880">4. Descensories: vessels for distillation "per descensum;" they
were placed under the fire, and the spirit to be extracted was
thrown downwards.
Croslets: crucibles; French, "creuset.".
Cucurbites: retorts; distilling-vessels; so called from their
likeness in shape to a gourd — Latin, "cucurbita."
Alembikes:stills, limbecs.</p>

<p id="id01881">5. Seared pokettes: the meaning of this phrase is obscure; but
if we take the reading "cered poketts," from the Harleian
manuscript, we are led to the supposition that it signifies
receptacles — bags or pokes — prepared with wax for some
process. Latin, "cera," wax.</p>

<p id="id01882">6. Argoil: potter's clay, used for luting or closing vessels in
the laboratories of the alchemists; Latin, "argilla;" French,
"argile."</p>

<p id="id01883">7. Citrination: turning to a citrine colour, or yellow, by
chemical action; that was the colour which proved the
philosopher's stone.</p>

<p id="id01884">8. Ingots: not, as in its modern meaning, the masses of metal
shaped by pouring into moulds; but the moulds themslves into
which the fused metal was poured. Compare Dutch,
"ingieten," part. "inghehoten," to infuse; German,
"eingiessen," part. "eingegossen," to pour in.</p>

<p id="id01885">9. Threpe: name; from Anglo-Saxon, "threapian."</p>

<p id="id01886">10. Bratt:  coarse cloak; Anglo-Saxon, "bratt." The word is
still used in Lincolnshire, and some parts of the north, to
signify a coarse kind of apron.</p>

<p id="id01887">11. Long on: in consequence of; the modern vulgar phrase "all
along of," or "all along on," best conveys the force of the
words in the text.</p>

<p id="id01888">12. Annualere: a priest employed in singing "annuals" or
anniversary masses for the dead, without any cure of souls;
the office was such as, in the Prologue to the Tales, Chaucer
praises the Parson for not seeking: Nor "ran unto London,
unto Saint Poul's, to seeke him a chantery for souls."</p>

<p id="id01889">13. Mortify:  a chemical phrase, signifying the dissolution of
quicksilver in acid.</p>

<p id="id01890">14. Blin: cease; from Anglo-Saxon, "blinnan," to desist.</p>

<p id="id01891">15. Name: took; from Anglo-Saxon, "niman," to take.
Compare German, "nehmen," "nahm."</p>

<p id="id01892">16. Los: praise, reputataion. See note 5 to Chaucer's tale of
Meliboeus.</p>

<p id="id01893">17. Grame: sorrow; Anglo-Saxon, "gram;" German, "Gram."</p>

<p id="id01894">18. Arnaldus Villanovanus, or Arnold de Villeneuve, was a
distinguished French chemist and physician of the fourteenth
century; his "Rosarium Philosophorum" was a favourite text-book
with the alchemists of the generations that succeeded.</p>

<p id="id01895">19. Hermes Trismegistus, counsellor of Osiris, King of
Egypt, was credited with the invention of writing and
hieroglyphics, the drawing up of the laws of the Egyptians,
and the origination of many sciences and arts. The
Alexandrian school ascribed to him the mystic learning which
it amplified; and the scholars of the Middle Ages regarded
with enthusiasm and reverence the works attributed to him —
notably a treatise on the philosopher's stone.</p>

<p id="id01896">20. Secret of secrets: "Secreta Secretorum;" a treatise, very
popular in the Middle Ages, supposed to contain the sum of
Aristotle's instructions to Alexander. Lydgate translated about
half of the work, when his labour was interrupted by his death
about 1460; and from the same treatise had been taken most
of the seventh book of Gower's "Confessio Amantis."</p>

<p id="id01897">21. Tyrwhitt says that this book was printed in the "Theatrum
Chemicum," under the title, "Senioris Zadith fi. Hamuelis
tabula chymica" ("The chemical tables of Senior Zadith, son
of Hamuel"); and the story here told of Plato and his disciple
was there related of Solomon, but with some variations.</p>

<p id="id01898">22. Ignotum per ignotius: To explain the unknown by the
more unknown.</p>

<p id="id01899">23. Though he multiply term of his live: Though he pursue the
alchemist's art all his days.</p>

Under the Blee, in Canterbury way?<br>

There gan our Hoste for to jape and play,<br>

And saide, "Sirs, what? Dun is in the mire.&lt;2&gt;<br>

Is there no man, for prayer nor for hire,<br>

That will awaken our fellow behind?<br>

A thief him might full* rob and bind                             *easily<br>

<p id="id01903">Awake, thou Cook," quoth he; "God give thee sorrow<br>

What aileth thee to sleepe *by the morrow?*            *in the day time*<br>

Hast thou had fleas all night, or art drunk?<br>

Or had thou with some quean* all night y-swunk,**      *whore **laboured<br>

So that thou mayest not hold up thine head?"<br>

The Cook, that was full pale and nothing red,<br>

Said to Host, "So God my soule bless,<br>

As there is fall'n on me such heaviness,<br>

I know not why, that me were lever* sleep,                       *rather<br>

Than the best gallon wine that is in Cheap."<br>

"Well," quoth the Manciple, "if it may do ease<br>

To thee, Sir Cook, and to no wight displease<br>

Which that here rideth in this company,<br>

And that our Host will of his courtesy,<br>

I will as now excuse thee of thy tale;<br>

For in good faith thy visage is full pale:<br>

Thine eyen daze,* soothly as me thinketh,                       *are dim<br>

And well I wot, thy breath full soure stinketh,<br>

That sheweth well thou art not well disposed;<br>

Of me certain thou shalt not be y-glosed.*                    *flattered<br>

See how he yawneth, lo, this drunken wight,<br>

As though he would us swallow anon right.<br>

Hold close thy mouth, man, by thy father's kin;<br>

The devil of helle set his foot therein!<br>

Thy cursed breath infecte will us all:<br>

Fy! stinking swine, fy! foul may thee befall.<br>

Ah! take heed, Sirs, of this lusty man.<br>

Now, sweete Sir, will ye joust at the fan?&lt;4&gt;<br>

Thereto, me thinketh, ye be well y-shape.<br>

I trow that ye have drunken wine of ape,&lt;5&gt;<br>

And that is when men playe with a straw."<br>
</p>

<p id="id01904">And with this speech the Cook waxed all wraw,*                 *wrathful<br>

And on the Manciple he gan nod fast<br>

For lack of speech; and down his horse him cast,<br>

Where as he lay, till that men him up took.<br>

This was a fair chevachie* of a cook:                *cavalry expedition<br>

Alas! that he had held him by his ladle!<br>

And ere that he again were in the saddle<br>

There was great shoving bothe to and fro<br>

To lift him up, and muche care and woe,<br>

So unwieldy was this silly paled ghost.<br>

And to the Manciple then spake our Host:<br>

"Because that drink hath domination<br>

Upon this man, by my salvation<br>

I trow he lewedly* will tell his tale.                         *stupidly<br>

For were it wine, or old or moisty* ale,                            *new<br>

That he hath drunk, he speaketh in his nose,<br>

And sneezeth fast, and eke he hath the pose &lt;6&gt;<br>

He also hath to do more than enough<br>

To keep him on his capel* out of the slough;                      *horse<br>

And if he fall from off his capel eftsoon,*                       *again<br>

Then shall we alle have enough to do'n<br>

In lifting up his heavy drunken corse.<br>

Tell on thy tale, of him *make I no force.*          *I take no account*<br>

But yet, Manciple, in faith thou art too nice*                  *foolish<br>

Thus openly to reprove him of his vice;<br>

Another day he will paraventure<br>

Reclaime thee, and bring thee to the lure; &lt;7&gt;<br>

I mean, he speake will of smalle things,<br>

As for to *pinchen at* thy reckonings,                   *pick flaws in*<br>

That were not honest, if it came to prefe."*                *test, proof<br>

Quoth the Manciple, "That were a great mischief;<br>

So might he lightly bring me in the snare.<br>

Yet had I lever* paye for the mare                               *rather<br>

That that I spake, I said it in my bourde.*                        *jest<br>

And weet ye what? I have here in my gourd<br>

A draught of wine, yea, of a ripe grape,<br>

And right anon ye shall see a good jape.*                         *trick<br>

This Cook shall drink thereof, if that I may;<br>

On pain of my life he will not say nay."<br>

And certainly, to tellen as it was,<br>

Of this vessel the cook drank fast (alas!<br>

What needed it? he drank enough beforn),<br>

And when he hadde *pouped in his horn,*                        *belched*<br>

To the Manciple he took the gourd again.<br>

And of that drink the Cook was wondrous fain,<br>

And thanked him in such wise as he could.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01905">Then gan our Host to laughe wondrous loud,<br>

And said, "I see well it is necessary<br>

Where that we go good drink with us to carry;<br>

For that will turne rancour and disease*             *trouble, annoyance<br>

T'accord and love, and many a wrong appease.<br>

O Bacchus, Bacchus, blessed be thy name,<br>

That so canst turnen earnest into game!<br>

Worship and thank be to thy deity.<br>

Of that mattere ye get no more of me.<br>

"Well, Sir," quoth he, "now hearken what I say."<br>

<p id="id01906" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prologue to the Manciple's Tale</p>

<p id="id01907" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Bob-up-and-down: Mr Wright supposes this to be the village of
Harbledown, near Canterbury, which  is situated on a hill, and near
which there are many ups and downs in the road. Like Boughton,
where the Canon and his Yeoman overtook the pilgrims, it stood on
the skirts of the Kentish forest of Blean or Blee.</p>

<p id="id01908">2. Dun is in the mire: a proverbial saying. "Dun" is a name for an
ass, derived from his colour.</p>

<p id="id01909">3. The mention of the Cook here, with no hint that he had already
told a story, confirms the indication given by the imperfect
condition of his Tale, that Chaucer intended to suppress the Tale
altogether, and make him tell a story in some other place.</p>

<p id="id01910">4. The quintain; called "fan" or "vane," because it turned round like
a weather-cock.</p>

<p id="id01911">5. Referring to the classification of wine, according to its effects on
a man, given in the old "Calendrier des Bergiers," The man of

<p id="id01915" style="margin-top: 2em">When Phoebus dwelled here in earth adown,<br>

As olde bookes make mentioun,<br>

He was the moste lusty* bacheler                               *pleasant<br>

Of all this world, and eke* the best archer.                       *also<br>

He slew Python the serpent, as he lay<br>

Sleeping against the sun upon a day;<br>

And many another noble worthy deed<br>

He with his bow wrought, as men maye read.<br>

Playen he could on every minstrelsy,<br>

And singe, that it was a melody<br>

To hearen of his cleare voice the soun'.<br>

Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,<br>

That with his singing walled the city,<br>

Could never singe half so well as he.<br>

Thereto he was the seemlieste man<br>

That is, or was since that the world began;<br>

What needeth it his features to descrive?<br>

For in this world is none so fair alive.<br>

He was therewith full fill'd of gentleness,<br>

Of honour, and of perfect worthiness.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01916">This Phoebus, that was flower of bach'lery,<br>

As well in freedom* as in chivalry,                          *generosity<br>

For his disport, in sign eke of victory<br>

Of Python, so as telleth us the story,<br>

Was wont to bearen in his hand a bow.<br>

Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow,<br>

Which in a cage he foster'd many a day,<br>

And taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.<br>

White was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,<br>

And counterfeit the speech of every man<br>

He coulde, when he shoulde tell a tale.<br>

Therewith in all this world no nightingale<br>

Ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal*                             *part<br>

Singe so wondrous merrily and well.<br>

Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife;<br>

Which that he loved more than his life.<br>

And night and day did ever his diligence<br>

Her for to please, and do her reverence:<br>

Save only, if that I the sooth shall sayn,<br>

Jealous he was, and would have kept her fain.<br>

For him were loth y-japed* for to be;                 *tricked, deceived<br>

And so is every wight in such degree;<br>

But all for nought, for it availeth nought.<br>

A good wife, that is clean of work and thought,<br>

Should not be kept in none await* certain:                  *observation<br>

And truely the labour is in vain<br>

To keep a shrewe,* for it will not be.               *ill-disposed woman<br>

This hold I for a very nicety,*                             *sheer folly<br>

<p id="id01917">Thus writen olde clerkes in their lives.<br>

This worthy Phoebus did all that he can<br>

To please her, weening, through such pleasance,<br>

And for his manhood and his governance,<br>

That no man should have put him from her grace;<br>

But, God it wot, there may no man embrace<br>

As to distrain* a thing, which that nature      *succeed in constraining<br>

Hath naturally set in a creature.<br>

Take any bird, and put it in a cage,<br>

And do all thine intent, and thy corage,*        *what thy heart prompts<br>

To foster it tenderly with meat and drink<br>

Of alle dainties that thou canst bethink,<br>

And keep it all so cleanly as thou may;<br>

Although the cage of gold be never so gay,<br>

For ever this bird will do his business<br>

T'escape out of his cage when that he may:<br>

His liberty the bird desireth aye. &lt;2&gt;<br>

Let take a cat, and foster her with milk<br>

And tender flesh, and make her couch of silk,<br>

And let her see a mouse go by the wall,<br>

Anon she weiveth* milk, and flesh, and all,                   *forsaketh<br>

Or least of reputation, will she take<br>

All these examples speak I by* these men              *with reference to<br>

On lower things to perform their delight<br>

Never so true, nor so debonair.*                           *gentle, mild<br>

The more harm is; it happens often so,<br>

Of which there cometh muche harm and woe.<br>

And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,<br>

The same I say, there is no difference<br>

(To Alexander told was this sentence),<br>

But, for the tyrant is of greater might<br>

By force of meinie* for to slay downright,                    *followers<br>

And burn both house and home, and make all plain,*                *level<br>

Lo, therefore is he call'd a capitain;<br>

And, for the outlaw hath but small meinie,<br>

And may not do so great an harm as he,<br>

Nor bring a country to so great mischief,<br>

Men calle him an outlaw or a thief.<br>

But, for I am a man not textuel,                       *learned in texts<br>

And when that home was come Phoebus the lord,<br>

This crowe sung, "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!"<br>

"What? bird," quoth Phoebus, "what song sing'st thou now?<br>

Wert thou not wont so merrily to sing,<br>

That to my heart it was a rejoicing<br>

To hear thy voice? alas! what song is this?"<br>

"By God," quoth he, "I singe not amiss.<br>

Phoebus," quoth he, "for all thy worthiness,<br>

For all thy beauty, and all thy gentleness,<br>

For all thy song, and all thy minstrelsy,<br>

<p id="id01922" style="margin-top: 2em">1. "The fable of 'The Crow,' says Tyrwhitt, "which is the
subject of the Manciple's Tale, has been related by so many
authors, from Ovid down to Gower, that it is impossible to
say whom Chaucer principally followed. His skill in new
dressing an old story was never, perhaps, more successfully
exerted."</p>

<p id="id01935" style="margin-top: 2em">THE TALE. &lt;1&gt;</p>

<p id="id01936" style="margin-top: 2em">[The Parson begins his "little treatise" -(which, if given at
length, would extend to about thirty of these pages, and which
cannot by any stretch of courtesy or fancy be said to merit the
title of a "Tale") in these words: —]</p>

<p id="id01937">Our sweet Lord God of Heaven, that no man will perish, but
will that we come all to the knowledge of him, and to the
blissful life that is perdurable [everlasting], admonishes us by
the prophet Jeremiah, that saith in this wise: "Stand upon the
ways, and see and ask of old paths, that is to say, of old
sentences, which is the good way, and walk in that way, and ye
shall find refreshing for your souls," &lt;2&gt; &amp;c.  Many be the
spiritual ways that lead folk to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
reign of glory; of which ways there is a full noble way, and full
convenable, which may not fail to man nor to woman, that
through sin hath misgone from the right way of Jerusalem
celestial; and this way is called penitence. Of which men should
gladly hearken and inquire with all their hearts, to wit what is
penitence, and whence it is called penitence, and in what
manner, and in how many manners, be the actions or workings
of penitence, and how many species there be of penitences, and
what things appertain and behove to penitence, and what things
disturb penitence.</p>

<p id="id01938">[Penitence is described, on the authority of Saints Ambrose,
Isidore, and Gregory, as the bewailing of sin that has been
wrought, with the purpose never again to do that thing, or any
other thing which a man should bewail; for weeping and not
ceasing to do the sin will not avail — though it is to be hoped
that after every time that a man falls, be it ever so often, he may
find grace to arise through penitence. And repentant folk that
leave their sin ere sin leave them, are accounted by Holy Church
sure of their salvation, even though the repentance be at the last
hour. There are three actions of penitence; that a man be
baptized after he has sinned; that he do no deadly sin after
receiving baptism; and that he fall into no venial sins from day
to day. "Thereof saith St Augustine, that penitence of good and
humble folk is the penitence of every day." The species of
penitence are three: solemn, when a man is openly expelled
from Holy Church in Lent, or is compelled by Holy Church to
do open penance for an open sin openly talked of in the
country; common penance, enjoined by priests in certain cases,
as to go on pilgrimage naked or barefoot; and privy penance,
which men do daily for private sins, of which they confess
privately and receive private penance. To very perfect penitence
are behoveful and necessary three things: contrition of heart,
confession of mouth, and satisfaction; which are fruitful
penitence against delight in thinking, reckless speech, and
wicked sinful works.</p>

<p id="id01939">Penitence may be likened to a tree, having its root in contrition,
biding itself in the heart as a tree-root does in the earth; out of
this root springs a stalk, that bears branches and leaves of
confession, and fruit of satisfaction. Of this root also springs a
seed of grace, which is mother of all security, and this seed is
eager and hot; and the grace of this seed springs of God,
through remembrance on the day of judgment and on the pains
of hell. The heat of this seed is the love of God, and the desire
of everlasting joy; and this heat draws the heart of man to God,
and makes him hate his sin. Penance is the tree of life to them
that receive it. In penance or contrition man shall understand
four things: what is contrition; what are the causes that move a
man to contrition; how he should be contrite; and what
contrition availeth to the soul. Contrition is the heavy and
grievous sorrow that a man receiveth in his heart for his sins,
with earnest purpose to confess and do penance, and never
more to sin. Six causes ought to move a man to contrition: 1.
He should remember him of his sins; 2. He should reflect that
sin putteth a man in great thraldom, and all the greater the
higher is the estate from which he falls; 3. He should dread the
day of doom and the horrible pains of hell; 4. The sorrowful
remembrance of the good deeds that  man hath omitted to do
here on earth, and also the good that he hath lost, ought to
make him have contrition; 5. So also ought the remembrance of
the passion that our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for our sins; 6.
And so ought the hope of three things, that is to say,
forgiveness of sin, the gift of grace to do well, and the glory of
heaven with which God shall reward man for his good deeds. —
All these points the Parson illustrates and enforces at length;
waxing especially eloquent under the third head, and plainly
setting forth the sternly realistic notions regarding future
punishments that were entertained in the time of Chaucer:-] &lt;3&gt;</p>

<p id="id01940">Certes, all the sorrow that a man might make from the
beginning of the world, is but a little thing, at retard of [in
comparison with] the sorrow of hell. The cause why that Job
calleth hell the land of darkness; &lt;4&gt; understand, that he calleth
it land or earth, for it is stable and never shall fail, and dark, for
he that is in hell hath default [is devoid] of light natural; for
certes the dark light, that shall come out of the fire that ever
shall burn, shall turn them all to pain that be in hell, for it
sheweth them the horrible devils that them torment. Covered
with the darkness of death; that is to say, that he that is in hell
shall have default of the sight of God; for certes the sight of
God is the life perdurable [everlasting]. The darkness of death,
be the sins that the wretched man hath done, which that disturb
[prevent] him to see the face of God, right as a dark cloud doth
between us and the sun. Land of misease, because there be three
manner of defaults against three things that folk of this world
have in this present life; that is to say, honours, delights, and
riches. Against honour have they in hell shame and confusion:
for well ye wot, that men call honour the reverence that man
doth to man; but in hell is no honour nor reverence; for certes
no more reverence shall be done there to a king than to a knave
[servant]. For which God saith by the prophet Jeremiah; "The
folk that me despise shall be in despite." Honour is also called
great lordship. There shall no wight serve other, but of harm
and torment. Honour is also called great dignity and highness;
but in hell shall they be all fortrodden [trampled under foot] of
devils. As God saith, "The horrible devils shall go and come
upon the heads of damned folk;" and this is, forasmuch as the
higher that they were in this present life, the more shall they be
abated [abased] and defouled in hell. Against the riches of this
world shall they have misease [trouble, torment] of poverty, and
this poverty shall be in four things: in default [want] of treasure;
of which David saith, "The rich folk that embraced and oned
[united] all their heart to treasure of this world, shall sleep in the
sleeping of death, and nothing shall they find in their hands of
all their treasure." And moreover, the misease of hell shall be in
default of meat and drink. For God saith thus by Moses, "They
shall be wasted with hunger, and the birds of hell shall devour
them with bitter death, and the gall of the dragon shall be their
drink, and the venom of the dragon their morsels." And
furthermore, their misease shall be in default of clothing, for
they shall be naked in body, as of clothing, save the fire in
which they burn, and other filths; and naked shall they be in
soul, of all manner virtues, which that is the clothing of the soul.
Where be then the gay robes, and the soft sheets, and the fine
shirts? Lo, what saith of them the prophet Isaiah, that under
them shall be strewed moths, and their covertures shall be of
worms of hell. And furthermore, their misease shall be in default
of friends, for he is not poor that hath good friends: but there is
no friend; for neither God nor any good creature shall be friend
to them, and evereach of them shall hate other with deadly hate.
The Sons and the daughters shall rebel against father and
mother, and kindred against kindred, and chide and despise each
other, both day and night, as God saith by the prophet Micah.
And the loving children, that whom loved so fleshly each other,
would each of them eat the other if they might. For how should
they love together in the pains of hell, when they hated each
other in the prosperity of this life? For trust well, their fleshly
love was deadly hate; as saith the prophet David; "Whoso
loveth wickedness, he hateth his own soul:" and whoso hateth
his own soul, certes he may love none other wight in no
manner: and therefore in hell is no solace nor no friendship, but
ever the more kindreds that be in hell, the more cursing, the
more chiding, and the more deadly hate there is among them.
And furtherover, they shall have default of all manner delights;
for certes delights be after the appetites of the five wits
[senses]; as sight, hearing, smelling, savouring [tasting], and
touching. But in hell their sight shall be full of darkness and of
smoke, and their eyes full of tears; and their hearing full of
waimenting [lamenting] and grinting [gnashing] of teeth, as
saith Jesus Christ; their nostrils shall be full of stinking; and, as
saith Isaiah the prophet, their savouring  [tasting] shall be full of
bitter gall; and touching of all their body shall be covered with
fire that never shall quench, and with worms that never shall
die, as God saith by the mouth of Isaiah. And forasmuch as they
shall not ween that they may die for pain, and by death flee from
pain, that may they understand in the word of Job, that saith,
"There is the shadow of death." Certes a shadow hath the
likeness of the thing of which it is shadowed, but the shadow is
not the same thing of which it is shadowed: right so fareth the
pain of hell; it is like death, for the horrible anguish; and why?
for it paineth them ever as though they should die anon; but
certes they shall not die. For, as saith Saint Gregory, "To
wretched caitiffs shall be given death without death, and end
without end, and default without failing; for their death shall
always live, and their end shall evermore begin, and their default
shall never fail." And therefore saith Saint John the Evangelist,
"They shall follow death, and they shall not find him, and they
shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them." And eke Job
saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath
created all things in right order, and nothing without order, but
all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that
be damned be not in order, nor hold no order. For the earth
shall bear them no fruit (for, as the prophet David saith, "God
shall destroy the fruit of the earth, as for them"); nor water shall
give them no moisture, nor the air no refreshing, nor the fire no
light. For as saith Saint Basil, "The burning of  the fire of this
world shall God give in hell to them that be damned, but the
light and the clearness shall be given in heaven to his children;
right as the good man giveth flesh to his children, and bones to
his hounds." And for they shall have no hope to escape, saith
Job at last, that there shall horror and grisly dread dwell without
end. Horror is always dread of harm that is to come, and this
dread shall ever dwell in the hearts of them that be damned.
And therefore have they lost all their hope for seven causes.
First, for God that is their judge shall be without mercy to them;
nor they may not please him; nor none of his hallows [saints];
nor they may give nothing for their ransom; nor they have no
voice to speak to him; nor they may not flee from pain; nor they
have no goodness in them that they may shew to deliver them
from pain.</p>

<p id="id01941">[Under the fourth head, of good works, the Parson says: —]</p>

<p id="id01942">The courteous Lord Jesus Christ will that no good work be lost,
for in somewhat it shall avail. But forasmuch as the good works
that men do while they be in good life be all amortised [killed,
deadened] by sin following, and also since all the good works
that men do while they be in deadly sin be utterly dead, as for to
have the life perdurable [everlasting], well may that man that no
good works doth, sing that new French song, J'ai tout perdu —
mon temps et mon labour &lt;5&gt;. For certes, sin bereaveth a man
both the goodness of nature, and eke the goodness of grace.
For soothly the grace of the Holy Ghost fareth like fire, that
may not be idle; for fire faileth anon as it forleteth [leaveth] its
working, and right so grace faileth anon as it forleteth its
working. Then loseth the sinful man the goodness of glory, that
only is to good men that labour and work. Well may he be sorry
then, that oweth all his life to God, as long as he hath lived, and
also as long as he shall live, that no goodness hath to pay with
his debt to God, to whom he oweth all his life: for trust well he
shall give account, as saith Saint Bernard, of all the goods that
have been given him in his present life, and how he hath them
dispended, insomuch that there shall not perish an hair of his
head, nor a moment of an hour shall not perish of his time, that
he shall not give thereof a reckoning.</p>

<p id="id01943">[Having treated of the causes, the Parson comes to the manner,
of contrition — which should be universal and total, not merely
of outward deeds of sin, but also of wicked delights and
thoughts and words; "for certes Almighty God is all good, and
therefore either he forgiveth all, or else right naught." Further,
contrition should be "wonder sorrowful and anguishous," and
also continual, with steadfast purpose of confession and
amendment. Lastly, of what contrition availeth, the Parson says,
that sometimes it delivereth man from sin; that without it neither
confession nor satisfaction is of any worth; that it "destroyeth
the prison of hell, and maketh weak and feeble all the strengths
of the devils, and restoreth the gifts of the Holy Ghost and of all
good virtues, and cleanseth the soul of sin, and delivereth it
from the pain of hell, and from the company of the devil, and
from the servage [slavery] of sin, and restoreth it to all goods
spiritual, and to the company and communion of Holy Church."
He who should set his intent to these things, would no longer be
inclined to sin, but would give his heart and body to the service
of Jesus Christ, and thereof do him homage. "For, certes, our
Lord Jesus Christ hath spared us so benignly in our follies, that
if he had not pity on man's soul, a sorry song might we all sing."</p>

<p id="id01944">The Second Part of the Parson's Tale or Treatise opens with an
explanation of what is confession — which is termed "the
second part of penitence, that is, sign of contrition;" whether it
ought needs be done or not; and what things be convenable to
true confession. Confession is true shewing of sins to the priest,
without excusing, hiding, or forwrapping [disguising] of
anything, and without vaunting of good works. "Also, it is
necessary to understand whence that sins spring, and how they
increase, and which they be." From Adam we took original sin;
"from him fleshly descended be we all, and engendered of vile
and corrupt matter;" and the penalty of Adam's transgression
dwelleth with us as to temptation, which penalty is called
concupiscence. "This concupiscence, when it is wrongfully
disposed or ordained in a man, it maketh him covet, by covetise
of flesh, fleshly sin by sight of his eyes, as to earthly things, and
also covetise of highness by pride of heart." The Parson
proceeds to shew how man is tempted in his flesh to sin; how,
after his natural concupiscence, comes suggestion of the devil,
that is to say the devil's bellows, with which he bloweth in man
the fire of con cupiscence; and how man then bethinketh him
whether he will do or no the thing to which he is tempted. If he
flame up into pleasure at the thought, and give way, then is he
all dead in soul; "and thus is sin accomplished, by temptation, by
delight, and by consenting; and then is the sin actual." Sin is
either venial, or deadly; deadly, when a man loves any creature
more than Jesus Christ our Creator, venial, if he love Jesus
Christ less than he ought. Venial sins diminish man's love to
God more and more, and may in this wise skip into deadly sin;
for many small make a great. "And hearken this example: A
great wave of the sea cometh sometimes with so great a
violence, that it drencheth [causes to sink] the ship: and the
same harm do sometimes the small drops, of water that enter
through a little crevice in the thurrok [hold, bilge], and in the
bottom of the ship, if men be so negligent that they discharge
them not betimes. And therefore, although there be difference
betwixt these two causes of drenching, algates [in any case] the
ship is dreint [sunk]. Right so fareth it sometimes of deadly sin,"
and of venial sins when they multiply in a man so greatly as to
make him love worldly things more than God. The Parson then
enumerates specially a number of sins which many a man
peradventure deems no sins, and confesses them not, and yet
nevertheless they are truly sins: — ]</p>

<p id="id01945">This is to say, at every time that a man eateth and drinketh more
than sufficeth to the sustenance of his body, in certain he doth
sin; eke when he speaketh more than it needeth, he doth sin; eke
when he heareth not benignly the complaint of the poor; eke
when he is in health of body, and will not fast when other folk
fast, without cause reasonable; eke when he sleepeth more than
needeth, or when he cometh by that occasion too late to church,
or to other works of charity; eke when he useth his wife without
sovereign desire of engendrure, to the honour of God, or for the
intent to yield his wife his debt of his body; eke when he will not
visit the sick, or the prisoner, if he may; eke if he love wife, or
child, or other worldly thing, more than reason requireth; eke if
he flatter or blandish more than he ought for any necessity; eke
if he minish or withdraw the alms of the poor; eke if he apparail
[prepare] his meat more deliciously than need is, or eat it too
hastily by likerousness [gluttony];  eke if he talk vanities in the
church, or at God's service, or that he be a talker of idle words
of folly or villainy, for he shall yield account of them at the day
of doom; eke when he behighteth [promiseth] or assureth to do
things that he may not perform; eke when that by lightness of
folly he missayeth or scorneth his neighbour; eke when he hath
any wicked suspicion of thing, that he wot of it no
soothfastness: these things, and more without number, be sins,
as saith Saint Augustine.</p>

<p id="id01946">[No earthly man may eschew all venial sins; yet may he refrain
him, by the burning love that he hath to our Lord Jesus Christ,
and by prayer and confession, and other good works, so that it
shall but little grieve. "Furthermore, men may also refrain and
put away venial sin, by receiving worthily the precious body of
Jesus Christ; by receiving eke of holy water; by alms-deed; by
general confession of Confiteor at mass, and at prime, and at
compline [evening service]; and by blessing of bishops and
priests, and by other good works." The Parson then proceeds to
weightier matters:— ]</p>

<p id="id01947">Now it is behovely [profitable, necessary] to tell which be
deadly sins, that is to say, chieftains of sins; forasmuch as all
they run in one leash, but in diverse manners. Now be they
called chieftains, forasmuch as they be chief, and of them spring
all other sins. The root of these sins, then, is pride, the general
root of all harms. For of this root spring certain branches: as ire,
envy, accidie &lt;6&gt; or sloth, avarice or covetousness (to common
understanding), gluttony, and lechery: and each of these sins
hath his branches and his twigs, as shall be declared in their
chapters following. And though so be, that no man can tell
utterly the number of the twigs, and of the harms that come of
pride, yet will I shew a part of them, as ye shall understand.
There is inobedience, vaunting, hypocrisy, despite, arrogance,
impudence, swelling of hearte, insolence, elation, impatience,
strife, contumacy, presumption, irreverence, pertinacity, vain-
glory and many another twig that I cannot tell nor declare. . . .]</p>

<p id="id01948">And yet [moreover] there is a privy species of pride that waiteth
first to be saluted ere he will salute, all [although] be he less
worthy than that other is; and eke he waiteth [expecteth] or
desireth to sit or to go above him in the way, or kiss the pax,
&lt;7&gt; or be incensed, or go to offering before his neighbour, and
such semblable [like] things, against his duty peradventure, but
that he hath his heart and his intent in such a proud desire to be
magnified and honoured before the people. Now be there two
manner of prides; the one of them is within the heart of a man,
and the other is without. Of which soothly these foresaid things,
and more than I have said, appertain to pride that is within the
heart of a man and there be other species of pride that be
without: but nevertheless, the one of these species of pride is
sign of the other, right as the gay levesell [bush] at the tavern is
sign of the wine that is in the cellar. And this is in many things:
as in speech and countenance, and outrageous array of clothing;
for certes, if there had been no sin in clothing, Christ would not
so soon have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man
in the gospel. And Saint Gregory saith, that precious clothing is
culpable for the dearth [dearness] of it, and for its softness, and
for its strangeness and disguising, and for the superfluity or for
the inordinate scantness of it; alas! may not a man see in our
days the sinful costly array of clothing, and namely [specially] in
too much superfluity, or else in too disordinate scantness? As to
the first sin, in superfluity of clothing, which that maketh it so
dear, to the harm of the people, not only the cost of the
embroidering, the disguising, indenting or barring, ounding,
paling, &lt;8&gt; winding, or banding, and semblable [similar] waste
of cloth in vanity; but there is also the costly furring [lining or
edging with fur] in their gowns, so much punching of chisels to
make holes, so much dagging [cutting] of shears, with the
superfluity in length of the foresaid gowns, trailing in the dung
and in the mire, on horse and eke on foot, as well of man as of
woman, that all that trailing is verily (as in effect) wasted,
consumed, threadbare, and rotten with dung, rather than it is
given to the poor, to great damage of the foresaid poor folk,
and that in sundry wise: this is to say, the more that cloth is
wasted, the more must it cost to the poor people for the
scarceness; and furthermore, if so be that they would give such
punched and dagged clothing to the poor people, it is not
convenient to wear for their estate, nor sufficient to boot [help,
remedy] their necessity, to keep them from the distemperance
[inclemency] of the firmament. Upon the other side, to speak of
the horrible disordinate scantness of clothing, as be these cutted
slops or hanselines [breeches] , that through their shortness
cover not the shameful member of man, to wicked intent alas!
some of them shew the boss and the shape of the horrible
swollen members, that seem like to the malady of hernia, in the
wrapping of their hosen, and eke the buttocks of them, that fare
as it were the hinder part of a she-ape in the full of the moon.
And more over the wretched swollen members that they shew
through disguising, in departing [dividing] of their hosen in
white and red, seemeth that half their shameful privy members
were flain [flayed]. And if so be that they depart their hosen in
other colours, as is white and blue, or white and black, or black
and red, and so forth; then seemeth it, by variance of colour,
that the half part of their privy members be corrupt by the fire
of Saint Anthony, or by canker, or other such mischance. And
of the hinder part of their buttocks it is full horrible to see, for
certes, in that part of their body where they purge their stinking
ordure, that foul part shew they to the people proudly in despite
of honesty [decency], which honesty Jesus Christ and his friends
observed to shew in his life. Now as of the outrageous array of
women, God wot, that though the visages of some of them
seem full chaste and debonair [gentle], yet notify they, in their
array of attire, likerousness and pride. I say not that honesty
[reasonable and appropriate style] in clothing of man or woman
unconvenable but, certes, the superfluity or disordinate scarcity
of clothing is reprovable. Also the sin of their ornament, or of
apparel, as in things that appertain to riding, as in too many
delicate horses, that be holden for delight, that be so fair, fat,
and costly; and also in many a vicious knave, [servant] that is
sustained because of them; in curious harness, as in saddles,
cruppers, peytrels, [breast-plates] and bridles, covered with
precious cloth and rich bars and plates of gold and silver. For
which God saith by Zechariah the prophet, "I will confound the
riders of such horses." These folk take little regard of the riding
of God's Son of heaven, and of his harness, when he rode upon
an ass, and had no other harness but the poor clothes of his
disciples; nor we read not that ever he rode on any other beast.
I speak this for the sin of superfluity, and not for reasonable
honesty [seemliness], when reason it requireth. And moreover,
certes, pride is greatly notified in holding of great meinie
[retinue of servants], when they be of little profit or of right no
profit, and namely [especially] when that meinie is felonous
[violent ] and damageous [harmful] to the people by hardiness
[arrogance] of high lordship, or by way of office; for certes,
such lords sell then their lordship to the devil of hell, when they
sustain the wickedness of their meinie. Or else, when these folk
of low degree, as they that hold hostelries, sustain theft of their
hostellers, and that is in many manner of deceits: that manner of
folk be the flies that follow the honey, or else the hounds that
follow the carrion. Such foresaid folk strangle spiritually their
lordships; for which thus saith David the prophet, "Wicked
death may come unto these lordships, and God give that they
may descend into hell adown; for in their houses is iniquity and
shrewedness, [impiety] and not God of heaven." And certes, but
if [unless] they do amendment, right as God gave his benison
[blessing] to Laban by the service of Jacob, and to Pharaoh by
the service of Joseph; right so God will give his malison
[condemnation] to such lordships as sustain the wickedness of
their servants, but [unless] they come to amendment. Pride of
the table apaireth [worketh harm] eke full oft; for, certes, rich
men be called to feasts, and poor folk be put away and rebuked;
also in excess of divers meats and drinks, and namely [specially]
such manner bake-meats and dish-meats burning of wild fire,
and painted and castled with paper, and semblable [similar]
waste, so that it is abuse to think. And eke in too great
preciousness of vessel, [plate] and curiosity of minstrelsy, by
which a man is stirred more to the delights of luxury, if so be
that he set his heart the less upon our Lord Jesus Christ, certain
it is a sin; and certainly the delights might be so great in this
case, that a man might lightly [easily] fall by them into deadly
sin.</p>

<p id="id01949">[The sins that arise of pride advisedly and habitually are deadly;
those that arise by frailty unadvised suddenly, and suddenly
withdraw again, though grievous, are not deadly. Pride itself
springs sometimes of the goods of nature, sometimes of the
goods of fortune, sometimes of the goods of grace; but the
Parson, enumerating and examining all these in turn, points out
how little security they possess and how little ground for pride
they furnish, and goes on to enforce the remedy against pride —
which is humility or meekness, a virtue through which a man
hath true knowledge of himself, and holdeth no high esteem of
himself in regard of his deserts, considering ever his frailty.]</p>

<p id="id01950">Now be there three manners [kinds] of humility; as humility in
heart, and another in the mouth, and the third in works. The
humility in the heart is in four manners: the one is, when a man
holdeth himself as nought worth before God of heaven; the
second is, when he despiseth no other man; the third is, when he
recketh not though men hold him nought worth; the fourth is,
when he is not sorry of his humiliation. Also the humility of
mouth is in four things: in temperate speech; in humility of
speech; and when he confesseth with his own mouth that he is
such as he thinketh that he is in his heart; another is, when he
praiseth the bounte [goodness] of another man and nothing
thereof diminisheth. Humility eke in works is in four manners:
the first is, when he putteth other men before him; the second is,
to choose the lowest place of all; the third is, gladly to assent to
good counsel; the fourth is, to stand gladly by the award
[judgment] of his sovereign, or of him that is higher in degree:
certain this is a great work of humility.</p>

<p id="id01951">[The Parson proceeds to treat of the other cardinal sins, and
their remedies: (2.) Envy, with its remedy, the love of God
principally and of our neighbours as ourselves: (3.) Anger, with
all its fruits in revenge, rancour, hate, discord, manslaughter,
blasphemy, swearing, falsehood, flattery, chiding and reproving,
scorning, treachery, sowing of strife, doubleness of tongue,
betraying of counsel to a man's disgrace, menacing, idle words,
jangling, japery or buffoonery, &amp;c. — and its remedy in the
virtues called mansuetude, debonairte, or gentleness, and
patience or sufferance: (4.) Sloth, or "Accidie," which comes
after the sin of Anger, because Envy blinds the eyes of a man,
and Anger troubleth a man, and Sloth maketh him heavy,
thoughtful, and peevish. It is opposed to every estate of man —
as unfallen, and held to work in praising and adoring God; as
sinful, and held to labour in praying for deliverance from sin;
and as in the state of grace, and held to works of penitence. It
resembles the heavy and sluggish condition of those in hell; it
will suffer no hardness and no penance; it prevents any
beginning of good works; it causes despair of God's mercy,
which is the sin against the Holy Ghost; it induces somnolency
and neglect of communion in prayer with God; and it breeds
negligence or recklessness, that cares for nothing, and is the
nurse of all mischiefs, if ignorance is their mother. Against
Sloth, and these and other branches and fruits of it, the remedy
lies in the virtue of fortitude or strength, in its various species of
magnanimity or great courage; faith and hope in God and his
saints; surety or sickerness, when a man fears nothing that can
oppose the good works he has under taken; magnificence, when
he carries out great works of goodness begun; constancy or
stableness of heart; and other incentives to energy and laborious
service: (5.) Avarice, or Covetousness, which is the root of all
harms, since its votaries are idolaters, oppressors and enslavers
of men, deceivers of their equals in business, simoniacs,
gamblers, liars, thieves, false swearers, blasphemers, murderers,
and sacrilegious. Its remedy lies in compassion and pity largely
exercised, and in reasonable liberality — for those who spend on
"fool-largesse," or ostentation of worldly estate and luxury,
shall receive the malison [condemnation] that Christ shall give
at the day of doom to them that shall be damned: (6.) Gluttony;
— of which the Parson treats so briefly that the chapter may be
given in full: — ]</p>

<p id="id01952">After Avarice cometh Gluttony, which is express against the
commandment of God. Gluttony is unmeasurable appetite to eat
or to drink; or else to do in aught to the unmeasurable appetite
and disordered covetousness [craving] to eat or drink. This sin
corrupted all this world, as is well shewed in the sin of Adam
and of Eve. Look also what saith Saint Paul of gluttony:
"Many," saith he, "go, of which I have oft said to you, and now
I say it weeping, that they be enemies of the cross of Christ, of
which the end is death, and of which their womb [stomach] is
their God and their glory;" in confusion of them that so savour
[take delight in] earthly things. He that is usant [accustomed,
addicted] to this sin of gluttony, he may no sin withstand, he
must be in servage [bondage] of all vices,  for it is the devil's
hoard, [lair, lurking-place] where he hideth him in and resteth.
This sin hath many species. The first is drunkenness, that is the
horrible sepulture of man's reason: and therefore when a man is
drunken, he hath lost his reason; and this is deadly sin. But
soothly, when that a man is not wont to strong drink, and
peradventure knoweth not the strength of the drink, or hath
feebleness in his head, or hath travailed [laboured], through
which he drinketh the more, all [although] be he suddenly
caught with drink, it is no deadly sin, but venial. The second
species of gluttony is, that the spirit of a man waxeth all
troubled for drunkenness, and bereaveth a man the discretion of
his wit. The third species of gluttony is, when a man devoureth
his meat, and hath no rightful manner of eating. The fourth is,
when, through the great abundance of his meat, the humours of
his body be distempered. The fifth is, forgetfulness by too much
drinking, for which a man sometimes forgetteth by the morrow
what be did at eve. In other manner be distinct the species of
gluttony, after Saint Gregory. The first is, for to eat or drink
before time. The second is, when a man getteth him too delicate
meat or drink. The third is, when men take too much over
measure [immoderately]. The fourth is curiosity [nicety] with
great intent [application, pains] to make and apparel [prepare]
his meat. The fifth is, for to eat too greedily. These be the five
fingers of the devil's hand, by which he draweth folk to the sin.</p>

<p id="id01953">Against gluttony the remedy is abstinence, as saith Galen; but
that I hold not meritorious, if he do it only for the health of his
body. Saint Augustine will that abstinence be done for virtue,
and with patience. Abstinence, saith he, is little worth, but  if
[unless] a man have good will thereto, and but it be enforced by
patience and by charity, and that men do it for God's sake, and
in hope to have the bliss in heaven. The fellows of abstinence be
temperance, that holdeth the mean in all things; also shame, that
escheweth all dishonesty [indecency, impropriety], sufficiency,
that seeketh no rich meats nor drinks, nor doth no force of [sets
no value on] no outrageous apparelling of meat; measure
[moderation] also, that restraineth by reason the unmeasurable
appetite of eating; soberness also, that restraineth the outrage of
drink; sparing also, that restraineth the delicate ease to sit long
at meat, wherefore some folk stand of their own will to eat,
because they will eat at less leisure.</p>

<p id="id01954">[At great length the Parson then points out the many varieties of
the sin of (7.) Lechery, and its remedy in chastity and
continence, alike in marriage and in widowhood; also in the
abstaining from all such indulgences of eating, drinking, and
sleeping as inflame the passions, and from the company of all
who may tempt to the sin. Minute guidance is given as to the
duty of confessing fully and faithfully the circumstances that
attend and may aggravate this sin; and the Treatise then passes
to the consideration of the conditions that are essential to a true
and profitable confession of sin in general. First, it must be in
sorrowful bitterness of spirit; a condition that has five signs —
shamefastness, humility in heart and outward sign, weeping with
the bodily eyes or in the heart, disregard of the shame that
might curtail or garble confession, and obedience to the penance
enjoined. Secondly, true confession must be promptly made, for
dread of death, of increase of sinfulness, of forgetfulness of
what should be confessed, of Christ's refusal to hear if it be put
off to the last day of life; and this condition has four terms; that
confession be well pondered beforehand, that the man
confessing have comprehended in his mind the number and
greatness of his sins and how long he has lain in sin, that he be
contrite for and eschew his sins, and that he fear and flee the
occasions for that sin to which he is inclined. — What follows
under this head is of some interest for the light which it throws
on the rigorous government wielded by the Romish Church in
those days —]</p>

<p id="id01955">Also thou shalt shrive thee of all thy sins to one man, and not a
parcel [portion] to one man, and a parcel to another; that is to
understand, in intent to depart [divide] thy confession for shame
or dread; for it is but strangling of thy soul. For certes Jesus
Christ is entirely all good, in him is none imperfection, and
therefore either he forgiveth all perfectly, or else never a deal
[not at all]. I say not that if thou be assigned to thy penitencer
&lt;9&gt; for a certain sin, that thou art bound to shew him all the
remnant of thy sins, of which thou hast been shriven of thy
curate, but if it like thee [unless thou be pleased] of thy
humility; this is no departing [division] of shrift. And I say not,
where I speak of division of confession, that if thou have license
to shrive thee to a discreet and an honest priest, and where thee
liketh, and by the license of thy curate, that thou mayest not
well shrive thee to him of all thy sins: but let no blot be behind,
let no sin be untold as far as thou hast remembrance. And when
thou shalt be shriven of thy curate, tell him eke all the sins that
thou hast done since thou wert last shriven. This is no wicked
intent of division of shrift. Also, very shrift [true confession]
asketh certain  conditions. First, that thou shrive thee by thy
free will, not constrained, nor for shame of folk, nor for malady
[sickness],  or such things: for it is reason, that he that
trespasseth by his free will, that by his free will he confess his
trespass; and that no other man tell his sin but himself; nor he
shall not nay nor deny his sin, nor wrath him against the priest
for admonishing him to leave his sin. The second condition is,
that thy shrift be lawful, that is to say, that thou that shrivest
thee, and eke the priest that heareth thy confession, be verily in
the faith of Holy Church, and that a man be not despaired of the
mercy of Jesus Christ, as Cain and Judas were. And eke a man
must accuse himself of his own trespass, and not another: but he
shall blame and wite [accuse] himself of his own malice and of
his sin, and none other: but nevertheless, if that another man be
occasion or else enticer of his sin, or the estate of the person be
such by which his sin is aggravated, or else that be may not
plainly shrive him but [unless] he tell the person with which he
hath sinned, then may he tell, so that his intent be not to
backbite the person, but only to declare his confession. Thou
shalt not eke make no leasings [falsehoods] in thy confession
for humility, peradventure, to say that thou hast committed and
done such sins of which that thou wert never guilty. For Saint
Augustine saith, "If that thou, because of humility, makest a
leasing on thyself, though thou were not in sin before, yet art
thou then in sin through thy leasing." Thou must also shew thy
sin by thine own proper mouth, but [unless] thou be dumb, and
not by letter; for thou that hast done the sin, thou shalt have the
shame of the confession. Thou shalt not paint thy confession
with fair and subtle words, to cover the more thy sin; for then
beguilest thou thyself, and not the priest; thou must tell it
plainly, be it never so foul nor so horrible. Thou shalt eke shrive
thee to a priest that is discreet to counsel thee; and eke thou
shalt not shrive thee for vain-glory, nor for hypocrisy, nor for
no cause but only for the doubt [fear] of Jesus' Christ and the
health of thy soul. Thou shalt not run to the priest all suddenly,
to tell him lightly thy sin, as who telleth a jape [jest] or a tale,
but advisedly and with good devotion; and generally shrive thee
oft; if thou oft fall, oft arise by confession. And though thou
shrive thee oftener than once of sin of which thou hast been
shriven, it is more merit; and, as saith Saint Augustine, thou
shalt have the more lightly [easily] release and grace of God,
both of sin and of pain. And certes, once a year at the least way,
it is lawful to be houseled, &lt;10&gt; for soothly once a year all
things in the earth renovelen [renew themselves].</p>

<p id="id01956">[Here ends the Second Part of the Treatise; the Third Part,
which contains the practical application of the whole, follows
entire, along with the remarkable "Prayer of Chaucer," as it
stands in the Harleian Manuscript:—]</p>

<p id="id01957">De Tertia Parte Poenitentiae. [Of the third part of penitence]</p>

<p id="id01958">Now have I told you of very [true] confession, that is the
second part of penitence: The third part of penitence is
satisfaction, and that standeth generally in almsdeed and bodily
pain. Now be there three manner of almsdeed: contrition of
heart, where a man offereth himself to God; the second is, to
have pity of the default of his neighbour; the third is, in giving
of good counsel and comfort, ghostly and bodily, where men
have need, and namely [specially] sustenance of man's food.
And take keep [heed] that a man hath need of these things
generally; he hath need of food, of clothing, and of herberow
[lodging], he hath need of charitable counsel and visiting in
prison and malady, and sepulture of his dead body. And if thou
mayest not visit the needful with thy person, visit them by thy
message and by thy gifts. These be generally alms or works of
charity of them that have temporal riches or discretion in
counselling. Of these works shalt thou hear at the day of doom.
This alms shouldest thou do of thine own proper things, and
hastily [promptly], and privily [secretly] if thou mayest; but
nevertheless, if thou mayest not do it privily, thou shalt not
forbear to do alms, though men see it, so that it be not done for
thank of the world, but only for thank of Jesus Christ. For, as
witnesseth Saint Matthew, chap. v., "A city may not be hid that
is set on a mountain, nor men light not a lantern and put it
under a bushel, but men set it on a candlestick, to light the men
in the house; right so shall your light lighten before men, that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father that is
in heaven."</p>

<p id="id01959">Now as to speak of bodily pain, it is in prayer, in wakings,
[watchings] in fastings, and in virtuous teachings. Of orisons ye
shall understand, that orisons or prayers is to say a piteous will
of heart, that redresseth it in God, and expresseth it by word
outward, to remove harms, and to have things spiritual and
durable, and sometimes temporal things. Of which orisons,
certes in the orison of the Pater noster hath our Lord Jesus
Christ enclosed most things. Certes, it is privileged of three
things in its dignity, for which it is more digne [worthy] than
any other prayer: for Jesus Christ himself made it: and it is
short, for [in order] it should be coude the more lightly, [be
more easily conned or learned] and to withhold [retain] it the
more easy in heart, and help himself the oftener with this orison;
and for a man should be the less weary to say it; and for a man
may not excuse him to learn it, it is so short and so easy: and
for it comprehendeth in itself all good prayers. The exposition
of this holy prayer, that is so excellent and so digne, I betake
[commit] to these masters of theology; save thus much will I
say, when thou prayest that God should forgive thee thy guilts,
as thou forgivest them that they guilt to thee, be full well ware
that thou be not out of charity. This holy orison aminisheth
[lesseneth] eke venial sin, and therefore it appertaineth specially
to penitence. This prayer must be truly said, and in very faith,
and that men pray to God ordinately, discreetly, and devoutly;
and always a man shall put his will to be subject to the will of
God. This orison must eke be said with great humbleness and
full pure, and honestly, and not to the annoyance of any man or
woman. It must eke be continued with the works of charity. It
availeth against the vices of the soul; for, assaith Saint Jerome,
by fasting be saved the vices of the flesh, and by prayer the
vices of the soul</p>

<p id="id01960">After this thou shalt understand, that bodily pain stands in
waking [watching].  For Jesus Christ saith "Wake and pray, that
ye enter not into temptation." Ye shall understand also, that
fasting stands in three things: in forbearing of bodily meat and
drink, and in forbearing of worldly jollity, and in forbearing of
deadly sin; this is to say, that a man shall keep him from deadly
sin in all that he may. And thou shalt understand eke, that God
ordained fasting; and to fasting appertain four things: largeness
[generosity] to poor folk; gladness of heart spiritual; not to be
angry nor annoyed nor grudge [murmur] for he fasteth; and also
reasonable hour for to eat by measure; that is to say, a man
should not eat in untime [out of time],  nor sit the longer at his
meal for [because] he fasteth. Then shalt thou understand, that
bodily pain standeth in discipline, or teaching, by word, or by
writing, or by ensample. Also in wearing of hairs [haircloth] or
of stamin [coarse hempen cloth], or of habergeons [mail-shirts]
&lt;11&gt; on their naked flesh for Christ's sake; but ware thee well
that such manner penance of thy flesh make not thine heart
bitter or angry, nor annoyed of thyself; for better is to cast away
thine hair than to cast away the sweetness of our Lord Jesus
Christ. And therefore saith Saint Paul, "Clothe you, as they that
be chosen of God in heart, of misericorde [with compassion],
debonairte [gentleness], sufferance [patience], and such manner
of clothing," of which Jesus Christ is more apaid [better
pleased] than of hairs or of hauberks. Then is discipline eke in
knocking of thy breast, in scourging with yards [rods], in
kneelings, in tribulations, in suffering patiently wrongs that be
done to him, and eke in patient sufferance of maladies, or losing
of worldly catel [chattels], or of wife, or of child, or of other
friends.</p>

<p id="id01961">Then shalt thou understand which things disturb penance, and
this is in four things; that is dread, shame, hope, and wanhope,
that is, desperation. And for to speak first of dread, for which
he weeneth that he may suffer no penance, thereagainst is
remedy for to think that bodily penance is but short and little at
the regard of [in comparison with] the pain of hell, that is so
cruel and so long, that it lasteth without end. Now against the
shame that a man hath to shrive him, and namely [specially]
these hypocrites, that would be holden so perfect, that they
have no need to shrive them; against that shame should a man
think, that by way of reason he that hath not been ashamed to
do foul things, certes he ought not to be ashamed to do fair
things, and that is confession. A man should eke think, that God
seeth and knoweth all thy thoughts, and all thy works; to him
may nothing be hid nor covered. Men should eke remember
them of the shame that is to come at the day of doom, to them
that be not penitent and shriven in this present life; for all the
creatures in heaven, and in earth, and in hell, shall see apertly
[openly] all that he hideth in this world.</p>

<p id="id01962">Now for to speak of them that be so negligent and slow to
shrive them; that stands in two manners. The one is, that he
hopeth to live long, and to purchase [acquire] much riches for
his delight, and then he will shrive him: and, as he sayeth, he
may, as him seemeth, timely enough come to shrift: another is,
the surquedrie [presumption &lt;12&gt;] that he hath in Christ's
mercy. Against the first vice, he shall think that our life is in no
sickerness, [security] and eke that all the riches in this world be
in adventure, and pass as a shadow on the wall; and, as saith St
Gregory, that it appertaineth to the great righteousness of God,
that never shall the pain stint [cease] of them, that never would
withdraw them from sin, their thanks [with their goodwill], but
aye continue in sin; for that perpetual will to do sin shall they
have perpetual pain. Wanhope [despair] is in two manners [of
two kinds]. The first wanhope is, in the mercy of God: the other
is, that they think they might not long persevere in goodness.
The first wanhope cometh of that he deemeth that he sinned so
highly and so oft, and so long hath lain in sin, that he shall not
be saved. Certes against that cursed wanhope should he think,
that the passion of Jesus Christ is more strong for to unbind,
than sin is strong for to bind. Against the second wanhope he
shall think, that as oft as he falleth, he may arise again by
penitence; and though he never so long hath lain in sin, the
mercy of Christ is always ready to receive him to mercy.
Against the wanhope that he thinketh he should not long
persevere in goodness, he shall think that the feebleness of the
devil may nothing do, but [unless] men will suffer him; and eke
he shall have strength of the help of God, and of all Holy
Church, and of the protection of angels, if him list.</p>

<p id="id01963">Then shall men understand, what is the fruit of penance; and
after the word of Jesus Christ, it is the endless bliss of heaven,
where joy hath no contrariety of woe nor of penance nor
grievance; there all harms be passed of this present life; there as
is the sickerness [security] from the pain of hell; there as is the
blissful company, that rejoice them evermore each of the other's
joy; there as the body of man, that whilom was foul and dark, is
more clear than the sun; there as the body of man that whilom
was sick and frail, feeble and mortal, is immortal, and so strong
and so whole, that there may nothing apair [impair, injure] it;
there is neither hunger, nor thirst, nor cold, but every soul
replenished with the sight of the perfect knowing of God. This
blissful regne [kingdom] may men purchase by poverty spiritual,
and the glory by lowliness, the plenty of joy by hunger and
thirst, the rest by travail, and the life by death and mortification
of sin; to which life He us bring, that bought us with his
precious blood! Amen.</p>

<p id="id01964" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Parson's Tale</p>

<p id="id01965" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The Parson's Tale is believed to be a translation, more or less
free, from some treatise on penitence that was in favour about
Chaucer's time. Tyrwhitt says: "I cannot recommend it as a very
entertaining or edifying performance at this day; but the reader
will please to remember, in excuse both of Chaucer and of his
editor, that, considering The Canterbury Tales as a great picture
of life and manners, the piece would not have been complete if
it had not included the religion of the time." The Editor of the
present volume has followed the same plan adopted with regard
to Chaucer's Tale of Meliboeus, and mainly for the same
reasons. (See note 1 to that Tale). An outline of the Parson's
ponderous sermon — for such it is — has been drawn; while
those passages have been given in full which more directly
illustrate the social and the religious life of the time — such as
the picture of hell, the vehement and rather coarse, but, in an
antiquarian sense, most curious and valuable attack on the
fashionable garb of the day, the catalogue of venial sins, the
description of gluttony and its remedy, &amp;c. The brief third or
concluding part, which contains the application of the whole,
and the "Retractation" or "Prayer" that closes the Tale and the
entire "magnum opus" of Chaucer, have been given in full.</p>

<p id="id01967">3. See Note 3 to the Sompnour's Tale.</p>

<p id="id01968">4. Just before, the Parson had cited the words of Job to God
(Job x. 20-22), "Suffer, Lord, that I may a while bewail and
weep, ere I go without returning to the dark land, covered with
the darkness of death; to the land of misease and of darkness,
where as is the shadow of death; where as is no order nor
ordinance, but grisly dread that ever shall last."</p>

<p id="id01971">7. The pax: an image which was presented to the people to be
kissed, at that part of the mass where the priest said, "Pax
Domini sit semper vobiscum." ("May the peace of the Lord be
always with you") The ceremony took the place, for greater
convenience, of the "kiss of peace," which clergy and people, at
this passage, used to bestow upon each other.</p>

<p id="id01978" style="margin-top: 2em">Now pray I to you all that hear this little treatise or read it, that
if there be anything in it that likes them, that thereof they thank
our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom proceedeth all wit and all
goodness; and if there be anything that displeaseth them, I pray
them also that they arette [impute] it to the default of mine
unconning [unskilfulness], and not to my will, that would fain
have said better if I had had conning; for the book saith, all that
is written for our doctrine is written. Wherefore I beseech you
meekly for the mercy of God that ye pray for me, that God have
mercy on me and forgive me my guilts, and namely [specially]
my translations and of inditing in worldly vanities, which I
revoke in my Retractions, as is the Book of Troilus, the Book
also of Fame, the Book of Twenty-five Ladies, the Book of the
Duchess, the Book of Saint Valentine's Day and of the
Parliament of Birds, the Tales of Canter bury, all those that
sounen unto sin, [are sinful, tend towards sin] the Book of the
Lion, and many other books, if they were in my mind or
remembrance, and many a song and many a lecherous lay, of the
which Christ for his great mercy forgive me the sins. But of the
translation of Boece de Consolatione, and other books of
consolation and of legend of lives of saints, and homilies, and
moralities, and devotion, that thank I our Lord Jesus Christ, and
his mother, and all the saints in heaven, beseeching them that
they from henceforth unto my life's end send me grace to bewail
my guilts, and to study to the salvation of my soul, and grant
me grace and space of very repentance, penitence, confession,
and satisfaction, to do in this present life, through the benign
grace of Him that is King of kings and Priest of all priests, that
bought us with his precious blood of his heart, so that I may be
one of them at the day of doom that shall be saved: Qui cum
Patre et Spiritu Sancto vivis et regnas Deus per omnia secula.

<p id="id01979" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to the Prayer of Chaucer</p>

<p id="id01980" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The genuineness and real significance of this "Prayer of
Chaucer," usually called his "Retractation," have been warmly
disputed. On the one hand, it has been declared that the monks
forged the retractation. and procured its insertion among the
works of the man who had done so much to expose their abuses
and ignorance, and to weaken their hold on popular credulity:
on the other hand, Chaucer himself at the close of his life, is
said to have greatly lamented the ribaldry and the attacks on the
clergy which marked especially "The Canterbury Tales," and to
have drawn up a formal retractation of which the "Prayer" is
either a copy or an abridgment. The beginning and end of the
"Prayer," as Tyrwhitt points out, are in tone and terms quite
appropriate in the mouth of the Parson, while they carry on the
subject of which he has been treating; and, despite the fact that
Mr Wright holds the contrary opinion, Tyrwhitt seems to be
justified in setting down the "Retractation" as interpolated into
the close of the Parson's Tale. Of the circumstances under
which the interpolation was made, or the causes by which it was
dictated, little or nothing can now be confidently affirmed; but
the agreement of the manuscripts and the early editions in
giving it, render it impossible to discard it peremptorily as a
declaration of prudish or of interested regret, with which
Chaucer himself had nothing whatever to do.</p>

<h4 id="id01982" style="margin-top: 2em">THE END OF THE CANTERBURY TALES</h4>

<h3 id="id01983" style="margin-top: 3em">                       THE COURT OF LOVE.</h3>

<p id="id01984" style="margin-top: 2em">"The Court Of Love" was probably Chaucer's first poem of any
consequence. It is believed to have been written at the age, and
under the circumstances, of which it contains express mention;
that is, when the poet was eighteen years old, and resided as a
student at Cambridge, — about the year 1346. The composition
is marked by an elegance, care, and finish very different from
the bold freedom which in so great measure distinguishes the
Canterbury Tales; and the fact is easily explained when we
remember that, in the earlier poem, Chaucer followed a beaten
path, in which he had many predecessors and competitors, all
seeking to sound the praises of love with the grace, the
ingenuity, and studious devotion, appropriate to the theme. The
story of the poem is exceedingly simple. Under the name of
Philogenet, a clerk or scholar of Cambridge, the poet relates
that, summoned by Mercury to the Court of Love, he journeys
to the splendid castle where the King and Queen of Love,
Admetus and Alcestis, keep their state. Discovering among the
courtiers a friend named Philobone, a chamberwoman to the
Queen, Philogenet is led by her into a circular temple, where, in
a tabernacle, sits Venus, with Cupid by her side. While he is
surveying the motley crowd of suitors to the goddess,
Philogenet is summoned back into the King's presence, chidden
for his tardiness in coming to Court, and commanded to swear
observance to the twenty Statutes of Love — which are recited
at length. Philogenet then makes his prayers and vows to
Venus, desiring that he may have for his love a lady whom he
has seen in a dream; and Philobone introduces him to the lady
herself, named Rosial, to whom he does suit and service of love.
At first the lady is obdurate to his entreaties; but, Philogenet
having proved the sincerity of his passion by a fainting fit,
Rosial relents, promises her favour, and orders Philobone to
conduct him round the Court. The courtiers are then minutely
described; but the description is broken off abruptly, and we are
introduced to Rosial in the midst of a confession of her love.
Finally she commands Philogenet to abide with her until the
First of May, when the King of Love will hold high festival; he
obeys; and the poem closes with the May Day festival service,
celebrated by a choir of birds, who sing an ingenious, but what
must have seemed in those days a more than slightly profane,
paraphrase or parody of the matins for Trinity Sunday, to the
praise of Cupid. From this outline, it will be seen at once that
Chaucer's "Court of Love" is in important particulars different
from the institutions which, in the two centuries preceding his
own, had so much occupied the attention of poets and gallants,
and so powerfully controlled the social life of the noble and
refined classes. It is a regal, not a legal, Court which the poet
pictures to us; we are not introduced to a regularly constituted
and authoritative tribunal in which nice questions of conduct in
the relations of lovers are discussed and decided — but to the
central and sovereign seat of Love's authority, where the
statutes are moulded, and the decrees are issued, upon which
the inferior and special tribunals we have mentioned frame their
proceedings. The "Courts of Love," in Chaucer's time, had lost
none of the prestige and influence which had been conferred
upon them by the patronage and participation of Kings, Queens,
Emperors, and Popes. But the institution, in its legal or judicial
character, was peculiar to France; and although the whole spirit
of Chaucer's poem, especially as regards the esteem and
reverence in which women were held, is that which animated
the French Courts, his treatment of the subject is broader and
more general, consequently more fitted to enlist the interest of
English readers.
(Transcriber's note: Modern scholars believe that Chaucer was
not the author of this poem)</p>

<p id="id01985">The poem consists of 206 stanzas of seven lines each; of which,
in this edition, eighty-three are represented by a prose
abridgement.</p>

</p>

<p id="id01993">Then — says the poet — did Love urge him to do
him obeisance, and to go "the Court of Love to
see, a lite [little] beside the Mount of Citharee."
&lt;8&gt; Mercury bade him, on pain of death, to
appear; and he went by strange and far countries
in search of the Court. Seeing at last a crowd of
people, "as bees," making their way thither, the
poet asked whither they went; and "one that
answer'd like a maid" said that they were bound to
the Court of Love, at Citheron,  where "the King
of Love, and all his noble rout [company],</p>

<p id="id01994">"Dwelleth within a castle royally."<br>

So them apace I journey'd forth among,<br>

And as he said, so found I there truly;<br>

For I beheld the town — so high and strong,<br>

And high pinnacles, large of height and long,<br>

With plate of gold bespread on ev'ry side,<br>

And precious stones, the stone work for to hide.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01995">No sapphire of Ind, no ruby rich of price,<br>

There lacked then, nor emerald so green,<br>

Balais, Turkeis, &lt;9&gt; nor thing, *to my devise,*        *in my judgement*<br>

That may the castle make for to sheen;*                    *be beautiful<br>

All was as bright as stars in winter be'n;<br>

And Phoebus shone, to make his peace again,<br>

For trespass* done to high estates twain,  —                   *offence<br>
</p>

<p id="id01996">When he had found Venus in the arms of Mars, and hastened to
tell Vulcan of his wife's infidelity &lt;10&gt;. Now he was shining
brightly on the castle, "in sign he looked after Love's grace;" for
there is no god in Heaven or in Hell "but he hath been right
subject unto Love." Continuing his description of the castle,
Philogenet says that he saw never any so large and high; within
and without, it was painted "with many a thousand daisies, red
as rose," and white also, in signification of whom, he knew not;
unless it was the flower of Alcestis &lt;11&gt;, who, under Venus,
was queen of the place, as Admetus was king;</p>

<p id="id01997">To whom obey'd the ladies good nineteen &lt;12&gt;,<br>

With many a thousand other, bright of face.<br>

And young men fele* came forth with lusty pace,               *many &lt;13&gt;<br>

And aged eke, their homage to dispose;<br>

But what they were, I could not well disclose.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01998">Yet nere* and nere* forth in I gan me dress,                     *nearer<br>

With arras &lt;14&gt; spread, and cloth of gold, I guess,<br>

And other silk *of easier avail;*    *less difficult, costly, to attain*<br>

Under the *cloth of their estate,* sans fail,             *state canopy*<br>

The Kinge's honour and the royalty.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02000">To treat of state affairs, Danger &lt;15&gt; stood by the
King, and Disdain by the Queen; who cast her eyes
haughtily about, sending forth beams that seemed
"shapen like a dart, sharp and piercing, and small and
straight of line;" while her hair shone as gold so fine,
"dishevel, crisp, down hanging at her back a yard in
length." &lt;16&gt; Amazed and dazzled by her beauty,
Philogenet stood perplexed, till he spied a Maid,
Philobone — a chamberwoman of the Queen's — who
asked how and on what errand he came thither.
Learning that he had been summoned by Mercury, she
told him that he ought to have come of his free will,
and that he "will be shent [rebuked, disgraced]"
because he did not.</p>

<p id="id02001">"For ye that reign in youth and lustiness,<br>

Pamper'd with ease, and jealous in your age,<br>

</p>

<p id="id02004">"Ye shall well see how rough and angry face<br>

The King of Love will show, when ye him see;<br>

Comfort is none, nor counsel to your ease;<br>

Why will ye then the King of Love displease?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02005">Thereupon Philogenet professed humble repentance,
and willingness to bear all hardship and chastisement
for his past offence.</p>

<p id="id02006">These wordes said, she caught me by the lap,*       *edge of the garment<br>

And led me forth into a temple round,<br>

Both large and wide; and, as my blessed hap<br>

A tabernacle &lt;18&gt; raised from the ground,<br>

Where Venus sat, and Cupid by her side;<br>

Yet half for dread I gan my visage hide.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02007">And eft* again I looked and beheld,                          *afterwards<br>

Their limbes well, — me thought a wonder case.                     *use<br>

The temple shone with windows all of glass,<br>

Bright as the day, with many a fair image;<br>

And there I saw the fresh queen of Carthage,<br>

Whose martyrdom was show'd about the walls;<br>

And how that fele* for love had suffer'd falls.**     *many **calamities<br>
</p>

<p id="id02009">Philogenet was astonished at the crowd of people that
he saw, doing sacrifice to the god and goddess.
Philobone informed him that they came from other
courts; those who knelt in blue wore the colour in
sign of their changeless truth &lt;21&gt;; those in black,
who uttered cries of grief, were the sick and dying of
love. The priests, nuns, hermits, and friars, and all that
sat in white, in russet and in green, "wailed of their
woe;" and for all people, of every degree, the Court
was open and free. While he walked about with
Philobone, a messenger from the King entered, and
summoned all the new-come folk to the royal
presence. Trembling and pale, Philogenet approached
the throne of Admetus, and was sternly asked why he
came so late to Court. He pleaded that a hundred
times he had been at the gate, but had been prevented
from entering by failure to see any of his
acquaintances, and by shamefacedness. The King
pardoned him, on condition that thenceforth he should
serve Love; and the poet took oath to do so, "though
Death therefor me thirle [pierce] with his spear."
When the King had seen all the new-comers, he
commanded an officer to take their oaths of
allegiance, and show them the Statutes of the Court,
which must be observed till death.</p>

<p id="id02010">And, for that I was letter'd, there I read<br>

The first statute that on the book was spread,<br>

Was, To be true in thought and deedes all<br>

But be content for all thing that may fall,<br>

And I shall crown him king of all delight!<br>

In all the Court there was not, to my sight,<br>

A lover true, that he was not adread,<br>

When he express* had heard the statute read.                    *plainly<br>

<p id="id02034">The eighteenth statute, wholly to commend,<br>

To please thy lady, is, That thou eschew<br>

And lightly set their pleasure in a place;<br>

When they misthink,* they lightly let it pace.            *think wrongly<br>
</p>

<p id="id02036">The nineteenth statute, Meat and drink forget:<br>

Each other day see that thou fast for love,<br>

For in the Court they live withoute meat,<br>

Save such as comes from Venus all above;<br>

They take no heed, *in pain of great reprove,*         *on pain of great<br>

Of meat and drink, for that is all in vain,                    reproach*<br>

Only they live by sight of their sov'reign.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02037">The twentieth statute, last of ev'ry one,<br>

Enrol it in thy hearte's privity;<br>

To wring and wail, to turn, and sigh, and groan,<br>

When that thy lady absent is from thee;<br>

And eke renew the wordes all that she<br>

Between you twain hath said, and all the cheer<br>

That thee hath made thy life's lady dear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02038">And see thy heart in quiet nor in rest<br>

Sojourn, till time thou see thy lady eft,*                        *again<br>

But whe'er* she won** by south, or east, or west,       *whether **dwell<br>

Be diligent, *till time* thy life be reft,         *until the time that*<br>

In that thou may'st, thy lady for to see;<br>

This statute was of old antiquity.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02039">The officer, called Rigour — who is incorruptible by
partiality, favour, prayer, or gold — made them swear
to keep the statutes; and, after taking the oath,
Philogenet turned over other leaves of the book,
containing the statutes of women. But Rigour sternly
bade him forbear; for no man might know the statutes
that belong to women.</p>

<p id="id02040">"In secret wise they kepte be full close;<br>

They sound* each one to liberty, my friend;                *tend, accord<br>

Pleasant they be, and to their own purpose;<br>

There wot* no wight of them, but God and fiend,                   *knows<br>

Nor aught shall wit, unto the worlde's end.<br>

The queen hath giv'n me charge, in pain to die,<br>

Never to read nor see them with mine eye.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02041">"For men shall not so near of counsel be'n<br>

With womanhead, nor knowen of their guise,<br>

Nor what they think, nor of their wit th'engine;*                 *craft<br>

*I me report to* Solomon the wise, &lt;25&gt;           *I refer for proof to*<br>

And mighty Samson, which beguiled thrice<br>

With Delilah was; he wot that, in a throw,<br>

There may no man statute of women know.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02042">"For it peradventure may right so befall,<br>

That they be bound by nature to deceive,<br>

And spin, and weep, and sugar strew on gall, &lt;26&gt;<br>

The heart of man to ravish and to reave,<br>

And whet their tongue as sharp as sword or gleve:*        *glaive, sword<br>

It may betide this is their ordinance,<br>

So must they lowly do their observance,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02043">"And keep the statute given them *of kind,*                  *by nature*<br>

Of such as Love hath giv'n them in their life.<br>

Men may not wit why turneth every wind,<br>

Nor waxe wise, nor be inquisitife<br>

To know secret of maid, widow, or wife;<br>

For they their statutes have to them reserved,<br>

And never man to know them hath deserved."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02044">Rigour then sent them forth to pay court to Venus,
and pray her to teach them how they might serve and
please their dames, or to provide with ladies those
whose hearts were yet vacant. Before Venus knelt a
thousand sad petitioners, entreating her to punish "the
false untrue," that had broken their vows, "barren of
ruth, untrue of what they said, now that their lust and
pleasure is allay'd." But the mourners were in a
minority;</p>

<p id="id02045">Yet eft again, a thousand million,<br>

Rejoicing, love, leading their life in bliss:<br>

They said: "Venus, redress* of all division,                     *healer<br>

Goddess eternal, thy name heried* is!                         *glorified<br>

By love's bond is knit all thing, y-wis,*                     *assuredly<br>

Beast unto beast, the earth to water wan,*                         *pale<br>

Bird unto bird, and woman unto man; &lt;27&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02046">"This is the life of joy that we be in,<br>

Resembling life of heav'nly paradise;<br>

Love is exiler ay of vice and sin;<br>

Love maketh heartes lusty to devise;<br>

Honour and grace have they in ev'ry wise,<br>

That be to love's law obedient;<br>

Love maketh folk benign and diligent;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02047">"Aye stirring them to dreade vice and shame:<br>

In their degree it makes them honourable;<br>

And sweet it is of love to bear the name,<br>

So that his love be faithful, true, and stable:<br>

Love pruneth him to seemen amiable;<br>

Love hath no fault where it is exercis'd,<br>

But sole* with them that have all love despis'd:"                  *only<br>
</p>

<p id="id02048">And they conclude with grateful honours to the goddess
— rejoicing hat they are hers in heart, and all inflamed
with her grace and heavenly fear. Philogenet now
entreats the goddess to remove his grief; for he also
loves, and hotly, only he does not know where —</p>

<p id="id02049">"Save only this, by God and by my troth;<br>

Troubled I was with slumber, sleep, and sloth<br>

This other night, and in a vision<br>

I saw a woman roamen up and down,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02050">"Of *mean stature,* and seemly to behold,              *middling height*<br>

Lusty and fresh, demure of countenance,<br>

Young and well shap'd, with haire sheen* as gold,               *shining<br>

With eyne as crystal, farced* with pleasance;                   *crammed<br>

And she gan stir mine heart a lite* to dance;                    *little<br>

But suddenly she vanish gan right there:<br>

Thus I may say, I love, and wot* not where."                       *know<br>
</p>

<p id="id02051">If he could only know this lady, he would serve and obey her
with all benignity; but if his destiny were otherwise, he would
gladly love and serve his lady, whosoever she might be. He
called on Venus for help to possess his queen and heart's life,
and vowed daily war with Diana: "that goddess chaste I keepen
[care] in no wise to serve; a fig for all her chastity!" Then he
rose and went his way, passing by a rich and beautiful shrine,
which, Philobone informed him, was the sepulchre of Pity. "A
tender creature," she said,</p>

<p id="id02052">"Is shrined there, and Pity is her name.<br>

She saw an eagle wreak* him on a fly,                            *avenge<br>

And pluck his wing, and eke him, *in his game;*              *for sport*<br>

And tender heart of that hath made her die:<br>

Eke she would weep, and mourn right piteously,<br>

To see a lover suffer great distress.<br>

In all the Court was none, as I do guess,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02053">"That could a lover half so well avail,*                           *help<br>

Nor of his woe the torment or the rage<br>

Aslake;* for he was sure, withoute fail,                        *assuage<br>

That of his grief she could the heat assuage.<br>

Instead of Pity, speedeth hot Courage<br>

The matters all of Court, now she is dead;<br>

*I me report in this to womanhead.*         *for evidence I refer to the<br>

                                         behaviour of women themselves.*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02054">"For wail, and weep, and cry, and speak, and pray, —<br>

Women would not have pity on thy plaint;<br>

Nor by that means to ease thine heart convey,<br>

But thee receive for their own talent:*                     *inclination<br>

And say that Pity caus'd thee, in consent<br>

Of ruth,* to take thy service and thy pain,                  *compassion<br>

In that thou may'st, to please thy sovereign."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02055">Philobone now promised to lead Philogenet to "the fairest lady
under sun that is," the "mirror of joy and bliss," whose name is
Rosial, and "whose heart as yet is given to no wight;"
suggesting that, as he also was "with love but light advanc'd,"
he might set this lady in the place of her of whom he had
dreamed. Entering a chamber gay, "there was Rosial, womanly
to see;" and the subtle-piercing beams of her eyes wounded
Philogenet to the heart. When he could speak, he threw himself
on his knees, beseeching her to cool his fervent woe:</p>

<p id="id02056">For there I took full purpose in my mind,<br>

Unto her grace my painful heart to bind.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02057">For, if I shall all fully her descrive,*                       *describe<br>

Her head was round, by compass of nature;<br>

Her hair as gold, she passed all alive,<br>

And lily forehead had this creature,<br>

With lively *browes flaw,* of colour pure,         *yellow eyebrows &lt;28&gt;<br>

Between the which was mean disseverance<br>

From ev'ry brow, to show a due distance.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02058">Her nose directed straight, even as line,<br>

With form and shape thereto convenient,<br>

In which the *goddes' milk-white path* doth shine;          *the galaxy*<br>

And eke her eyne be bright and orient<br>

As is the smaragd,* unto my judgment,                           *emerald<br>

Or yet these starres heav'nly, small, and bright;<br>

Her visage is of lovely red and white.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02059">Her mouth is short, and shut in little space,<br>

Flaming somedeal,* not over red I mean,                        *somewhat<br>

With pregnant lips, and thick to kiss, percase*           *as it chanced<br>

(For lippes thin, not fat, but ever lean,<br>

They serve of naught, they be not worth a bean;<br>

For if the bass* be full, there is delight;                   *kiss &lt;29&gt;<br>

Maximian &lt;30&gt; truly thus doth he write).<br>
</p>

<p id="id02060">But to my purpose: I say, white as snow<br>

Be all her teeth, and in order they stand<br>

Of one stature; and eke her breath, I trow,<br>

Surmounteth all odours that e'er I fand*                          *found<br>

In sweetness; and her body, face, and hand<br>

Be sharply slender, so that, from the head<br>

Unto the foot, all is but womanhead.*                *womanly perfection<br>
</p>

<p id="id02061">I hold my peace of other thinges hid:<br>

Here shall my soul, and not my tongue, bewray;<br>

But how she was array'd, if ye me bid,<br>

That shall I well discover you and say:<br>

A bend* of gold and silk, full fresh and gay,                      *band<br>

With hair *in tress, y-broidered* full well,        *plaited in tresses*<br>

Right smoothly kempt,* and shining every deal.                   *combed<br>
</p>

<p id="id02062">About her neck a flow'r of fresh device<br>

With rubies set, that lusty were to see'n;<br>

And she in gown was, light and summer-wise,<br>

Shapen full well, the colour was of green,<br>

With *aureate seint* about her sides clean,            *golden cincture*<br>

With divers stones, precious and rich:<br>

Thus was she ray'd,* yet saw I ne'er her lich,**         *arrayed **like<br>
</p>

<p id="id02063">If Jove had but seen this lady, Calisto and Alcmena had never
lain in his arms, nor had he loved the fair Europa, nor Danae,
nor Antiope; "for all their beauty stood in Rosial; she seemed
like a thing celestial." By and by, Philogenet presented to her his
petition for love, which she heard with some haughtiness; she
was not, she said, well acquainted with him, she did not know
where he dwelt, nor his name and condition. He informed her
that "in art of love he writes," and makes songs that may be
sung in honour of the King and Queen of Love. As for his name
—</p>

<p id="id02064">"My name? alas, my heart, why mak'st thou strange?*         *why so cold<br>

Philogenet I call'd am far and near,                        or distant?*<br>

Of Cambridge clerk, that never think to change<br>

From you, that with your heav'nly streames* clear        *beams, glances<br>

Ravish my heart; and ghost, and all in fere:*              *all together<br>

Since at the first I writ my bill* for grace,                  *petition<br>

Me thinks I see some mercy in your face;"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02065">And again he humbly pressed his suit. But the lady disdained the
idea that, "for a word of sugar'd eloquence," she should have
compassion in so little space; "there come but few who speede
here so soon." If, as he says, the beams of her eyes pierce and
fret him, then let him withdraw from her presence:</p>

<p id="id02066">"Hurt not yourself, through folly, with a look;<br>

I would be sorry so to make you sick!<br>

A woman should beware eke whom she took:<br>

Ye be a clerk: go searche well my book,<br>

If any women be so light* to win:                                  *easy<br>

Nay, bide a while, though ye were *all my kin."*       *my only kindred*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02067">He might sue and serve, and wax pale, and green, and dead,
without murmuring in any wise; but whereas he desired her
hastily to lean to love, he was unwise, and must cease that
language. For some had been at Court for twenty years, and
might not obtain their mistresses' favour; therefore she
marvelled that he was so bold as to treat of love with her.
Philogenet, on this, broke into pitiful lamentation; bewailing the
hour in which he was born, and assuring the unyielding lady that
the frosty grave and cold must be his bed, unless she relented.</p>

<p id="id02068">With that I fell in swoon, and dead as stone,<br>

With colour slain,* and wan as ashes pale;                    *deathlike<br>

And by the hand she caught me up anon:<br>

"Arise," quoth she; "what? have ye drunken dwale?* *sleeping potion &lt;31&gt;<br>

Why sleepe ye? It is no nightertale."*                       *night-time<br>

"Now mercy! sweet," quoth I, y-wis afraid;<br>

"What thing," quoth she, "hath made you so dismay'd?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02069">She said that by his hue she knew well that he was a lover; and
if he were secret, courteous, and kind, he might know how all
this could be allayed. She would amend all that she had missaid,
and set his heart at ease; but he must faithfully keep the statutes,
"and break them not for sloth nor ignorance." The lover
requests, however, that the sixteenth may be released or
modified, for it "doth him great grievance;" and she complies.</p>

<p id="id02070">And softly then her colour gan appear,<br>

As rose so red, throughout her visage all;<br>

Wherefore methinks it is according* her                  *appropriate to<br>

That she of right be called Rosial.<br>

Thus have I won, with wordes great and small,<br>

Some goodly word of her that I love best,<br>

And trust she shall yet set mine heart in rest.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02071">Rosial now told Philobone to conduct Philogenet all over the
Court, and show him what lovers and what officers dwelt there;
for he was yet a stranger.</p>

<p id="id02072">And, stalking soft with easy pace, I saw<br>

About the king standen all environ,*                        *around &lt;32&gt;<br>

Attendance, Diligence, and their fellaw<br>

Furtherer, Esperance,* and many one;                               *Hope<br>

Dread-to-offend there stood, and not alone;<br>

For there was eke the cruel adversair,<br>

The lover's foe, that called is Despair;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02073">Which unto me spake angrily and fell,*                          *cruelly<br>

And said, my lady me deceive shall:<br>

"Trow'st thou," quoth she, "that all that she did tell<br>

Is true? Nay, nay, but under honey gall.<br>

Thy birth and hers they be no thing egal:*                        *equal<br>

Cast off thine heart, &lt;33&gt; for all her wordes white,<br>

For in good faith she loves thee but a lite.*                    *little<br>
</p>

<p id="id02074">"And eke remember, thine ability<br>

May not compare with her, this well thou wot."<br>

Yea, then came Hope and said, "My friend, let be!<br>

Believe him not: Despair he gins to doat."<br>

"Alas," quoth I, "here is both cold and hot:<br>

The one me biddeth love, the other nay;<br>

Thus wot I not what me is best to say.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02075">"But well wot I, my lady granted me<br>

Truly to be my wounde's remedy;<br>

Her gentleness* may not infected be                        *noble nature<br>

With doubleness,* this trust I till I die."                   *duplicity<br>

So cast I t' avoid Despair's company,<br>

And take Hope to counsel and to friend.<br>

"Yea, keep that well," quoth Philobone, "in mind."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02076">And there beside, within a bay window,<br>

Stood one in green, full large of breadth and length,<br>

His beard as black as feathers of the crow;<br>

His name was Lust, of wondrous might and strength;<br>

And with Delight to argue there he think'th,<br>

For this was alway his opinion,<br>

That love was sin: and so he hath begun<br>
</p>

<p id="id02077">To reason fast, and *ledge authority:*               *allege authorities<br>

"Nay," quoth Delight, "love is a virtue clear,<br>

And from the soul his progress holdeth he:<br>

Blind appetite of lust doth often steer,*              *stir (the heart)<br>

And that is sin; for reason lacketh there:<br>

For thou dost think thy neighbour's wife to win;<br>

Yet think it well that love may not be sin;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02078">"For God, and saint, they love right verily,<br>

Void of all sin and vice: this know I weel,*                       *well<br>

Affection of flesh is sin truly;<br>

But very* love is virtue, as I feel;                               *true<br>

For very love may frail desire akele:*                             *cool<br>

For very love is love withoute sin."<br>

"Now stint,"* quoth Lust, "thou speak'st not worth a pin."        *cease<br>
</p>

<p id="id02079">And there I left them in their arguing,<br>

Roaming farther into the castle wide,<br>

And in a corner Liar stood talking<br>

Of leasings* fast, with Flattery there beside;               *falsehoods<br>

He said that women *ware attire of pride,                          *wore<br>

And men were found of nature variant,<br>

And could be false and *showe beau semblant.*          *put on plausible<br>

                                                 appearances to deceive*<br>

Then Flattery bespake and said, y-wis:<br>

"See, so she goes on pattens fair and feat;*               *pretty, neat<br>

It doth right well: what pretty man is this<br>

That roameth here? now truly drink nor meat<br>

Need I not have, my heart for joy doth beat<br>

Him to behold, so is he goodly fresh:<br>

It seems for love his heart is tender and nesh."*             *soft &lt;34&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02080">This is the Court of lusty folk and glad,<br>

And well becomes their habit and array:<br>

O why be some so sorry and so sad,<br>

Complaining thus in black and white and gray?<br>

Friars they be, and monkes, in good fay:<br>

Alas, for ruth! great dole* it is to see,                        *sorrow<br>

To see them thus bewail and sorry be.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02081">See how they cry and ring their handes white,<br>

For they so soon* went to religion!,                              *young<br>

And eke the nuns with veil and wimple plight,*                  *plaited<br>

Their thought is, they be in confusion:<br>

"Alas," they say, "we feign perfection, &lt;35&gt;<br>

In clothes wide, and lack our liberty;<br>

But all the sin must on our friendes be. &lt;36&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02082">"For, Venus wot, we would as fain* as ye,                        *gladly<br>

That be attired here and *well beseen,*                  *gaily clothed*<br>

Desire man, and love in our degree,'<br>

Firm and faithful, right as would the Queen:<br>

Our friendes wick', in tender youth and green,<br>

Against our will made us religious;<br>

That is the cause we mourn and waile thus."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02083">Then said the monks and friars *in the tide,*         *at the same time*<br>

"Well may we curse our abbeys and our place,<br>

Our statutes sharp to sing in copes wide, &lt;37&gt;<br>

Chastely to keep us out of love's grace,<br>

And never to feel comfort nor solace;*                          *delight<br>

Yet suffer we the heat of love's fire,<br>

And after some other haply we desire.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02084">"O Fortune cursed, why now and wherefore<br>

Hast thou," they said, "bereft us liberty,<br>

Since Nature gave us instrument in store,<br>

And appetite to love and lovers be?<br>

Why must we suffer such adversity,<br>

Dian' to serve, and Venus to refuse?<br>

Full *often sithe* these matters do us muse.               *many a time*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02085">"We serve and honour, sore against our will,<br>

Of chastity the goddess and the queen;<br>

*Us liefer were* with Venus bide still,                *we would rather*<br>

And have regard for love, and subject be'n<br>

Unto these women courtly, fresh, and sheen.*          *bright, beautiful<br>

Fortune, we curse thy wheel of variance!<br>

Where we were well, thou reavest* our pleasance."           *takest away<br>
</p>

<p id="id02086">Thus leave I them, with voice of plaint and care,<br>

In raging woe crying full piteously;<br>

And as I went, full naked and full bare<br>

Some I beheld, looking dispiteously,<br>

On Poverty that deadly cast their eye;<br>

And "Well-away!" they cried, and were not fain,<br>

For they might not their glad desire attain.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02087">For lack of riches worldly and of good,<br>

They ban and curse, and weep, and say, "Alas!<br>

That povert' hath us hent,* that whilom stood                    *seized<br>

At hearte's ease, and free and in good case!<br>

But now we dare not show ourselves in place,<br>

Nor us embold* to dwell in company,                  *make bold, venture<br>

Where as our heart would love right faithfully."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02088">And yet againward shrieked ev'ry nun,<br>

The pang of love so strained them to cry:<br>

"Now woe the time," quoth they, "that we be boun'!*               *bound<br>

This hateful order nice* will do us die!        *into which we foolishly<br>

We sigh and sob, and bleeden inwardly,                           entered<br>

Fretting ourselves with thought and hard complaint,<br>

That nigh for love we waxe wood* and faint."                        *mad<br>
</p>

<p id="id02089">And as I stood beholding here and there,<br>

I was ware of a sort* full languishing,               *a class of people<br>

Savage and wild of looking and of cheer,<br>

Their mantles and their clothes aye tearing;<br>

And oft they were of Nature complaining,<br>

For they their members lacked, foot and hand,<br>

With visage wry, and blind, I understand.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02090">They lacked shape and beauty to prefer<br>

Themselves in love: and said that God and Kind*                  *Nature<br>

Had forged* them to worshippe the sterre,**            *fashioned **star<br>

Venus the bright, and leften all behind<br>

His other workes clean and out of mind:<br>

"For other have their full shape and beauty,<br>

And we," quoth they, "be in deformity."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02091">And nigh to them there was a company,<br>

That have the Sisters warray'd and missaid,<br>

I mean the three of fatal destiny, &lt;38&gt;<br>

That be our workers: suddenly abraid,*                          *aroused<br>

Out gan they cry as they had been afraid;<br>

"We curse," quoth they, "that ever hath Nature<br>

Y-formed us this woeful life t'endure."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02092">And there eke was Contrite, and gan repent,<br>

Confessing whole the wound that Cythere &lt;39&gt;<br>

Had with the dart of hot desire him sent,<br>

And how that he to love must subject be:<br>

Then held he all his scornes vanity,<br>

And said that lovers held a blissful life,<br>

Young men and old, and widow, maid, and wife.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02093">"Bereave me, Goddess!" quoth he, "of thy might,<br>

My scornes all and scoffes, that I have<br>

No power for to mocken any wight<br>

That in thy service dwell: for I did rave;<br>

This know I well right now, so God me save,<br>

And I shall be the chief post* of thy faith,               *prop, pillar<br>

And love uphold, the reverse whoso saith."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02094">Dissemble stood not far from him in truth,<br>

With party* mantle, party hood and hose;                 *parti-coloured<br>

And said he had upon his lady ruth,*                               *pity<br>

And thus he wound him in, and gan to glose,<br>

Of his intent full double, I suppose:<br>

In all the world he said he lov'd her weel;<br>

But ay me thought he lov'd her *ne'er a deal.*             *never a jot*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02095">Eke Shamefastness was there, as I took heed,<br>

That blushed red, and durst not be y-know<br>

She lover was, for thereof had she dread;<br>

She stood and hung her visage down alow;<br>

But such a sight it was to see, I trow,<br>

As of these roses ruddy on their stalk:<br>

There could no wight her spy to speak or talk<br>
</p>

<p id="id02096">In love's art, so gan she to abash,<br>

Nor durst not utter all her privity:<br>

Many a stripe and many a grievous lash<br>

She gave to them that woulde lovers be,<br>

And hinder'd sore the simple commonalty,<br>

That in no wise durst grace and mercy crave,<br>

For *were not she,* they need but ask and have;            *but for her*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02097">Where if they now approache for to speak,<br>

Then Shamefastness *returneth them* again:             *turns them back*<br>

They think, "If we our secret counsel break,<br>

Our ladies will have scorn us certain,<br>

And peradventure thinke great disdain:"<br>

Thus Shamefastness may bringen in Despair;<br>

When she is dead the other will be heir.<br>

<p id="id02098"> "Come forth Avaunter! now I ring thy bell!" &lt;40&gt;<br>

I spied him soon; to God I make avow,*                       *confession<br>

"The first," quoth he, "that ever I did wow,*                       *woo<br>

*Within a word she came,* I wot not how,               *she was won with<br>

Like high, and broad, and, as I me advise,<br>

The Golden Love and Leaden Love &lt;43&gt; they hight:*           *were called<br>

The one was sad, the other glad and light.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02111">At this point there is a hiatus in the poem, which abruptly ceases
to narrate the tour of Philogenet and Philobone round the
Court, and introduces us again to Rosial, who is speaking thus
to her lover, apparently in continuation of a confession of love:</p>

<p id="id02112">"Yes! draw your heart, with all your force and might,<br>

To lustiness, and be as ye have said."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02113">She admits that she would have given him no drop of favour,
but that she saw him "wax so dead of countenance;" then Pity
"out of her shrine arose from death to life," whisperingly
entreating that she would do him some pleasance. Philogenet
protests his gratitude to Pity, his faithfulness to Rosial; and the
lady, thanking him heartily, bids him abide with her till the
season of May, when the King of Love and all his company will
hold his feast fully royally and well. "And there I bode till that
the season fell."</p>

<p id="id02114">On May Day, when the lark began to rise,<br>

To matins went the lusty nightingale,<br>

Within a temple shapen hawthorn-wise;<br>

He might not sleep in all the nightertale,*                  *night-time<br>

But "Domine" &lt;44&gt; gan he cry and gale,*                        *call out<br>

"My lippes open, Lord of Love, I cry,<br>

And let my mouth thy praising now bewry."*                   *show forth<br>
</p>

<p id="id02115">The eagle sang "Venite," &lt;45&gt; bodies all,<br>

And let us joy to love that is our health."<br>

And to the desk anon they gan to fall,<br>

And who came late he pressed in by stealth<br>

Then said the falcon, "Our own heartes' wealth,<br>

'Domine Dominus noster,' &lt;46&gt; I wot,<br>

Ye be the God that do* us burn thus hot."                          *make<br>

And then came in the goldfinch fresh and gay,<br>

And said this psalm with heartly glad intent,<br>

"Domini est terra;" &lt;48&gt; this Latin intent,*                      *means<br>

The God of Love hath earth in governance:<br>

And then the wren began to skip and dance.<br>

<p id="id02118">The second lesson robin redbreast sang,<br>

"Hail to the God and Goddess of our lay!"*                *law, religion<br>

And to the lectern amorously he sprang:<br>

"Hail now," quoth be, "O fresh season of May,<br>

*Our moneth glad that singen on the spray!*      *glad month for us that<br>

</p>

<p id="id02119">The third lesson the turtle-dove took up,<br>

And thereat laugh'd the mavis* in a scorn:                    *blackbird<br>

There be right here a thousand better born,<br>

To read this lesson, which as well as he,<br>

And eke as hot, can love in all degree."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02120">The turtle-dove said, "Welcome, welcome May,<br>

Gladsome and light to lovers that be true!<br>

I thank thee, Lord of Love, that doth purvey<br>

<p id="id02128" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to The Court of Love</p>

<p id="id02129" style="margin-top: 2em">1. So the Man of Law, in the prologue to his Tale, is made to
say that Chaucer "can but lewedly (ignorantly or imperfectly) on
metres and on rhyming craftily." But the humility of those
apologies is not justified by the care and finish of his earlier
poems.</p>

<p id="id02130">2. Born: burnish, polish: the poet means, that his verses do not
display the eloquence or brilliancy of Cicero in setting forth his
subject-matter.</p>

<p id="id02131">3. Galfrid: Geoffrey de Vinsauf to whose treatise on poetical
composition a less flattering allusion is made in The Nun's
Priest's Tale. See note 33 to that Tale.</p>

<p id="id02132">4. Stirp: race, stock; Latin, "stirps."</p>

<p id="id02133">5. Calliope is the epic muse — "sister" to the other eight.</p>

<p id="id02134">6. Melpomene was the tragic muse.</p>

<p id="id02135">7. The same is said of Griselda, in The Clerk's Tale; though she
was of tender years, "yet in the breast of her virginity there was
inclos'd a sad and ripe corage"</p>

<p id="id02136">8. The confusion which Chaucer makes between Cithaeron and
Cythera, has already been remarked.  See note 41 to the
Knight's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02137">9. Balais: Bastard rubies; said to be so called from Balassa, the
Asian country where they were found. Turkeis: turquoise
stones.</p>

<p id="id02138">10. Spenser, in his description of the House of Busirane, speaks
of the sad distress into which Phoebus was plunged by Cupid, in
revenge for the betrayal of "his mother's wantonness, when she
with Mars was meint [mingled] in joyfulness"</p>

<p id="id02139">11. Alcestis, daughter of Pelias, was won to wife by Admetus,
King of Pherae, who complied with her father's demand that he
should come to claim her in a chariot drawn by lions and boars.
By the aid of Apollo — who tended the flocks of Admetus
during his banishment from heaven — the suitor fulfilled the
condition; and Apollo further induced the Moirae or Fates to
grant that Admetus should never die, if his father, mother, or
wife would die for him. Alcestis devoted herself in his stead;
and, since each had made great efforts or sacrifices for love, the
pair are fitly placed as king and queen in the Court of Love.</p>

<p id="id02140">12. In the prologue to the "Legend of Good Women," Chaucer
says that behind the God of Love, upon the green, he "saw
coming in ladies nineteen;" but the stories of only nine good
women are there told. In the prologue to The Man of Law's
Tale, sixteen ladies are named as having their stories written in
the "Saints' Legend of Cupid" — now known as the "Legend of
Good Women" — (see note 5 to the Prologue to the Man of
Law's Tale); and in the "Retractation," at the end of the Parson's
Tale, the "Book of the Twenty-five Ladies" is enumerated
among the works of which the poet repents — but there "xxv" is
supposed to have been by some copyist written for "xix."</p>

<p id="id02141">13. fele: many; German, "viele."</p>

<p id="id02142">14. Arras: tapestry of silk, made at Arras, in France.</p>

<p id="id02143">15. Danger, in the Provencal Courts of Love, was the
allegorical personification of the husband; and Disdain suitably
represents the lover's corresponding difficulty from the side of
the lady.</p>

<p id="id02144">16. In The Knight's Tale, Emily's yellow hair is braided in a
tress, or plait, that hung a yard long behind her back; so that,
both as regards colour and fashion, a singular resemblance
seems to have existed between the female taste of 1369 and that
of 1869.</p>

<p id="id02145">17. In an old monkish story — reproduced by Boccaccio, and
from him by La Fontaine in the Tale called "Les Oies de Frere
Philippe"  — a young man is brought up without sight or
knowledge of women, and, when he sees them on a visit to the
city, he is told that they are geese.</p>

<p id="id02146">18. Tabernacle: A shrine or canopy of stone, supported by
pillars.</p>

<p id="id02147">19. Mister folk:  handicraftsmen, or tradesmen, who have
learned "mysteries."</p>

<p id="id02148">20. The loves "Of Queen Annelida and False Arcite" formed the
subject of a short unfinished poem by Chaucer, which was
afterwards worked up into The Knight's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02149">21. Blue was the colour of truth. See note 36 to the Squire's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id02150">22. Blife: quickly, eagerly; for "blive" or "belive."</p>

<p id="id02151">23. It will be seen afterwards that Philogenet does not relish it,
and pleads for its relaxation.</p>

<p id="id02152">24. Feat: dainty, neat, handsome; the same as "fetis," oftener
used in Chaucer; the adverb "featly" is still used, as applied to
dancing, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id02153">25. Solomon was beguiled by his heathenish wives to forsake
the worship of the true God; Samson fell a victim to the wiles of
Delilah.</p>

<p id="id02154">26. Compare the speech of Proserpine to Pluto, in The
Merchant's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02155">27. See note 91 to the Knight's Tale for a parallel.</p>

<p id="id02156">28. Flaw: yellow; Latin, "flavus," French, "fauve."</p>

<p id="id02157">29. Bass: kiss; French, "baiser;" and hence the more vulgar
"buss."</p>

<p id="id02158">30. Maximian: Cornelius Maximianus Gallus flourished in the
time of the Emperor Anastasius; in one of his elegies, he
professed a preference for flaming and somewhat swelling lips,
which, when he tasted them, would give him full kisses.</p>

<p id="id02159">31. Dwale: sleeping potion, narcotic. See note 19 to the Reeve's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id02160">32. Environ: around; French, "a l'environ."</p>

<p id="id02161">33. Cast off thine heart: i.e.  from confidence in her.</p>

<p id="id02162">34. Nesh: soft, delicate; Anglo-Saxon, "nese."</p>

<p id="id02163">35. Perfection: Perfectly holy life, in the performance of vows
of poverty, chastity, obedience, and other modes of mortifying
the flesh.</p>

<p id="id02164">36. All the sin must on our friendes be: who made us take the
vows before they knew our own dispositions, or ability, to keep
them.</p>

<p id="id02165">37. Cope: The large vestment worn in singing the service in the
choir. In Chaucer's time it seems to have been a distinctively
clerical piece of dress; so, in the prologue to The Monk's Tale,
the Host, lamenting that so stalwart a man as the Monk should
have gone into religion, exclaims, "Alas! why wearest thou so
wide a cope?"</p>

<p id="id02166">38. The three of fatal destiny: The three Fates.</p>

<p id="id02167">39. Cythere:  Cytherea  —  Venus, so called from the name of
the island, Cythera, into which her worship was first introduced
from Phoenicia.</p>

<p id="id02168">40. Avaunter: Boaster; Philobone calls him out.</p>

<p id="id02169">41. The statute: i.e. the 16th.</p>

<p id="id02170">42. "Metamorphoses" Lib. ii. 768 et seqq., where a general
description of Envy is given.</p>

<p id="id02171">43. Golden Love and Leaden Love represent successful and
unsuccessful love; the first kindled by Cupid's golden darts, the
second by his leaden arrows.</p>

<p id="id02172">44. "Domine, labia mea aperies — et os meam annunciabit
laudem tuam" ("Lord, open my lips — and my mouth will
announce your praise") Psalms li. 15, was the verse with which
Matins began. The stanzas which follow contain a paraphrase of
the matins for Trinity Sunday, allegorically setting forth the
doctrine that love is the all-controlling influence in the
government of the
universe.</p>

<p id="id02173">45. "Venite, exultemus," ("Come, let us rejoice") are the first
words of Psalm xcv. called the "Invitatory."</p>

<p id="id02174">46. "Domine Dominus noster:" The opening words of Psalm
viii.; "O Lord our Lord."</p>

<p id="id02175">47. "Coeli enarrant:" Psalm xix. 1; "The heavens declare (thy
glory)."</p>

<p id="id02176">48. "Domini est terra": Psalm xxiv. I; "The earth is the Lord's
and the fulness thereof." The first "nocturn" is now over, and
the lessons from Scripture follow.</p>

<p id="id02177">49. "Jube, Domine:" "Command, O Lord;" from Matthew xiv.
28, where Peter, seeing Christ walking on the water, says
"Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water."</p>

<p id="id02178">50: "Tu autem:" the formula recited by the reader at the end of
each lesson; "Tu autem, Domine, miserere nobis." ("But do
thou, O Lord, have pity on us!")</p>

<p id="id02179">51. "Te Deum Amoris:" "Thee, God of Love (we praise)."</p>

<p id="id02180">52. Not Tubal, who was the worker in metals; but Jubal, his
brother, "who was the father of all such as handle the harp and
organ" (Genesis iv. 21).</p>

<p id="id02181">53. "Dominus regnavit:"  Psalm xciii. 1, "The Lord reigneth."
With this began the "Laudes," or morning service of praise.</p>

<p id="id02182">54. "Jubilate:" Psalm c. 1, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord."</p>

<p id="id02183">55. "Benedicite:" "Bless ye the Lord;" the opening of the Song
of the Three Children</p>

<p id="id02184">56. "Laudate:" Psalm cxlvii.; "Praise ye the Lord."</p>

<p id="id02185">57. "O admirabile:" Psalm viii 1; "O Lord our God, how
excellent is thy name."</p>

<p id="id02186">58. "Benedictus": The first word of the Song of Zacharias
(Luke i. 68); "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel"</p>

<p id="id02187">59. In The Knight's Tale we have exemplifications of the
custom of gathering and wearing flowers and branches on May
Day; where Emily, "doing observance to May," goes into the
garden at sunrise and gathers flowers, "party white and red, to
make a sotel garland for her head"; and again, where Arcite
rides to the fields "to make him a garland of the greves; were it
of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves"</p>

<h3 id="id02188" style="margin-top: 3em">                 THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE.</h3>

<p id="id02189" style="margin-top: 2em">[THE noble vindication of true love, as an exalting, purifying,
and honour-conferring power, which Chaucer has made in "The
Court of Love," is repeated in "The Cuckoo and the
Nightingale." At the same time, the close of the poem leads up
to "The Assembly of Fowls;" for, on the appeal of the
Nightingale, the dispute between her and the Cuckoo, on the
merits and blessings of love, is referred to a parliament of birds,
to be held on the morrow after Saint Valentine's Day. True, the
assembly of the feathered tribes described by Chaucer, though
held on Saint Valentine's Day, and engaged in the discussion of
a controversy regarding love, is not occupied with the particular
cause which in the present poem the Nightingale appeals to the
parliament. But "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale" none the less
serves as a link between the two poems; indicating as it does the
nature of those controversies, in matters subject to the supreme
control of the King and Queen of Love, which in the subsequent
poem we find the courtiers, under the guise of birds, debating in
full conclave and under legal forms. Exceedingly simple in
conception, and written in a metre full of musical irregularity
and forcible freedom, "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale" yields
in vividness, delicacy, and grace to none of Chaucer's minor
poems. We are told that the poet, on the third night of May, is
sleepless, and rises early in the morning, to try if he may hear
the Nightingale sing. Wandering by a brook-side, he sits down
on the flowery lawn, and ere long, lulled by the sweet melody of
many birds and the well-according music of the stream, he falls
into a kind of doze — "not all asleep, nor fully waking." Then
(an evil omen) he hears the Cuckoo sing before the Nightingale;
but soon he hears the Nightingale request the Cuckoo to
remove far away, and leave the place to birds that can sing. The
Cuckoo enters into a defence of her song, which becomes a
railing accusation against Love and a recital of the miseries
which Love's servants endure; the Nightingale vindicates Love
in a lofty and tender strain, but is at last overcome with sorrow
by the bitter words of the Cuckoo, and calls on the God of
Love for help. On this the poet starts up, and, snatching a stone
from the brook, throws it at the Cuckoo, who flies away full
fast. The grateful Nightingale promises that, for this service, she
will be her champion's singer all that May; she warns him
against believing the Cuckoo, the foe of Love; and then, having
sung him one of her new songs, she flies away to all the other
birds that are in that dale, assembles them, and demands that
they should do her right upon the Cuckoo. By one assent it is
agreed that a parliament shall be held, "the morrow after Saint
Valentine's Day," under a maple before the window of Queen
Philippa at Woodstock, when judgment shall be passed upon
the Cuckoo; then the Nightingale flies into a hawthorn, and
sings a lay of love so loud that the poet awakes. The five-line
stanza, of which the first, second, and fifth lines agree in one
rhyme, the third and fourth in another, is peculiar to this poem;
and while the prevailing measure is the decasyllabic line used in
the "Canterbury Tales," many of the lines have one or two
syllables less. The poem is given here without abridgement.]
(Transcriber's note: Modern scholars believe that Chaucer was
not the author of this poem)</p>

<p id="id02195">For when that they may hear the birdes sing,<br>

And see the flowers and the leaves spring,<br>

That bringeth into hearte's remembrance<br>

A manner ease, *medled with grievance,*            *mingled with sorrow*<br>

And lusty thoughtes full of great longing.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02196">And of that longing cometh heaviness,<br>

And thereof groweth greate sickeness,<br>

And &lt;2&gt; for the lack of that that they desire:<br>

And thus in May be heartes set on fire,<br>

So that they brennen* forth in great distress.                     *burn<br>
</p>

<p id="id02197">I speake this of feeling truely;<br>

If I be old and unlusty,<br>

Yet I have felt the sickness thorough May<br>

*Both hot and cold, an access ev'ry day,*         *every day a hot and a<br>

How sore, y-wis, there wot no wight but I.                     cold fit*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02198">I am so shaken with the fevers white,<br>

Of all this May sleep I but lite;*                               *little<br>

And also it is not like* unto me                               *pleasing<br>

That any hearte shoulde sleepy be,<br>

In whom that Love his fiery dart will smite,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02199">But as I lay this other night waking,<br>

I thought how lovers had a tokening,*                      *significance<br>

And among them it was a common tale,<br>

That it were good to hear the nightingale<br>

Rather than the lewd cuckoo sing.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02200">And then I thought, anon* it was day,                          *whenever<br>

I would go somewhere to assay<br>

If that I might a nightingale hear;<br>

For yet had I none heard of all that year,<br>

And it was then the thirde night of May.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02201">And anon as I the day espied,<br>

No longer would I in my bed abide;<br>

But to a wood that was fast by,<br>

I went forth alone boldely,<br>

And held the way down by a brooke's side,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02202">Till I came to a laund* of white and green,                        *lawn<br>

So fair a one had I never in been;<br>

The ground was green, *y-powder'd with daisy,*     *strewn with daisies*<br>

The flowers and the *greves like high,*      *bushes of the same height*<br>

All green and white; was nothing elles seen.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02203">There sat I down among the faire flow'rs,<br>

And saw the birdes trip out of their bow'rs,<br>

There as they rested them alle the night;<br>

They were so joyful of the daye's light,<br>

They began of May for to do honours.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02204">They coud* that service all by rote;                               *knew<br>

There was many a lovely note!<br>

Some sange loud as they had plain'd,<br>

And some in other manner voice feign'd,<br>

And some all out with the full throat.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02205">They proined* them, and made them right gay,     *preened their feathers<br>

And danc'd and leapt upon the spray;<br>

And evermore two and two in fere,*                             *together<br>

Right so as they had chosen them to-year*                     *this year<br>

In Feverere* upon Saint Valentine's Day.                       *February<br>
</p>

<p id="id02206">And the river that I sat upon,*                                  *beside<br>

It made such a noise as it ran,<br>

Accordant* with the birde's harmony,                  *keeping time with<br>

Me thought it was the beste melody<br>

That might be heard of any man.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02207">And for delight, I wote never how,<br>

I fell in such a slumber and a swow, —                           *swoon<br>

Not all asleep, nor fully waking, —<br>

And in that swow me thought I hearde sing<br>

The sorry bird, the lewd cuckow;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02208">And that was on a tree right faste by.<br>

But who was then *evil apaid* but I?                       *dissatisfied<br>

"Now God," quoth I, "that died on the crois,*                     *cross<br>

Give sorrow on thee, and on thy lewed voice!<br>

Full little joy have I now of thy cry."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02209">And as I with the cuckoo thus gan chide,<br>

I heard, in the next bush beside,<br>

A nightingale so lustily sing,<br>

That her clear voice she made ring<br>

Through all the greenwood wide.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02210">"Ah, good Nightingale," quoth I then,<br>

"A little hast thou been too long hen;*                   *hence, absent<br>

For here hath been the lewd cuckow,<br>

And sung songs rather* than hast thou:                           *sooner<br>

I pray to God that evil fire her bren!"*                           *burn<br>
</p>

<p id="id02211">But now I will you tell a wondrous thing:<br>

As long as I lay in that swooning,<br>

Me thought I wist what the birds meant,<br>

And what they said, and what was their intent<br>

And of their speech I hadde good knowing.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02212">There heard I the nightingale say:<br>

"Now, good Cuckoo, go somewhere away,<br>

And let us that can singe dwelle here;<br>

For ev'ry wight escheweth* thee to hear,                          *shuns<br>

Thy songes be so elenge,* in good fay."**               *strange **faith<br>
</p>

<p id="id02213">"What," quoth she, "what may thee all now<br>

It thinketh me, I sing as well as thou,<br>

For my song is both true and plain,<br>

Although I cannot crakel* so in vain,                  *sing tremulously<br>

As thou dost in thy throat, I wot ne'er how.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02214">"And ev'ry wight may understande me,<br>

But, Nightingale, so may they not do thee,<br>

For thou hast many a nice quaint* cry;                          *foolish<br>

I have thee heard say, 'ocy, ocy;' &lt;3&gt;<br>

How might I know what that should be?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02215">"Ah fool," quoth she, "wost thou not what it is?<br>

When that I say, 'ocy, ocy,' y-wis,<br>

Then mean I that I woulde wonder fain<br>

That all they were shamefully slain,                                *die<br>

That meanen aught againe love amiss.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02216">"And also I would that all those were dead,<br>

That thinke not in love their life to lead,<br>

For who so will the god of Love not serve,<br>

I dare well say he is worthy to sterve,*                            *die<br>

And for that skill,* 'ocy, ocy,' I grede."**               *reason **cry<br>
</p>

<p id="id02217">"Ey!" quoth the cuckoo, "this is a quaint* law,                 *strange<br>

That every wight shall love or be to-draw!*              *torn to pieces<br>

But I forsake alle such company;<br>

For mine intent is not for to die,<br>

Nor ever, while I live, *on Love's yoke to draw.*      *to put on love's<br>

"For lovers be the folk that be alive,<br>

That most disease have, and most unthrive,*                  *misfortune<br>

And most endure sorrow, woe, and care,<br>

And leaste feelen of welfare:<br>

What needeth it against the truth to strive?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02218">"What?" quoth she, "thou art all out of thy mind!<br>

How mightest thou in thy churlishness find<br>

To speak of Love's servants in this wise?<br>

For in this world is none so good service<br>

To ev'ry wight that gentle is of kind;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02219">"For thereof truly cometh all gladness,<br>

All honour and all gentleness,<br>

Worship, ease, and all hearte's lust,*                         *pleasure<br>

Perfect joy, and full assured trust,<br>

Jollity, pleasance, and freshness,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02220">"Lowlihead, largess, and courtesy,<br>

In that belief I will live and dey;<br>

And, Cuckoo, so I rede* that thou, do y-wis."                   *counsel<br>

"Then," quoth he, "let me never have bliss,<br>

If ever I to that counsail obey!<br>
</p>

<p id="id02222">"Nightingale, thou speakest wondrous fair,<br>

But, for all that, is the sooth contrair;<br>

For love is in young folk but rage,<br>

And in old folk a great dotage;<br>

Who most it useth, moste shall enpair.*                     *suffer harm<br>

<p id="id02223">"For thereof come disease and heaviness,<br>

Sorrow and care, and many a great sickness,<br>

Pride, mischief, povert', and woodness.*                        *madness<br>

</p>

<p id="id02225">"And, Nightingale, therefore hold thee nigh;<br>

For, 'lieve me well, for all thy quainte cry,<br>

If thou be far or longe from thy make,*                            *mate<br>

Thou shalt be as other that be forsake,<br>

And then thou shalt hoten* as do I."                          *be called<br>
</p>

<p id="id02226">"Fie," quoth she, "on thy name and on thee!<br>

The god of Love let thee never the!*                             *thrive<br>

For thou art worse a thousand fold than wood,*                      *mad<br>

That had been naught, ne hadde Love y-be.<br>

<p id="id02228">"Thou Nightingale," he said, "be still!<br>

For ofttime untrue folk he easeth,<br>

And true folk so bitterly displeaseth,<br>

That for default of grace* he lets them spill."**    *favour **be ruined<br>
</p>

<p id="id02229">Then took I of the nightingale keep,<br>

How she cast a sigh out of her deep,<br>

And said, "Alas, that ever I was bore!<br>

I can for teen* not say one worde more;"                *vexation, grief<br>

And right with that word she burst out to weep.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02230">"Alas!" quoth she, "my hearte will to-break<br>

To heare thus this lewd bird speak<br>

Of Love, and of his worshipful service.<br>

Now, God of Love, thou help me in some wise,<br>

That I may on this cuckoo be awreak!"*                         *revenged<br>
</p>

<p id="id02231">Methought then I start up anon,<br>

And to the brook I ran and got a stone,<br>

And at the cuckoo heartly cast;<br>

And for dread he flew away full fast,<br>

And glad was I when he was gone.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02232">And evermore the cuckoo, as he flay,*                              *flew<br>

He saide, "Farewell, farewell, popinjay,"<br>

As though he had scorned, thought me;<br>

But ay I hunted him from the tree,<br>

Until he was far out of sight away.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02233">And then came the nightingale to me,<br>

And said, "Friend, forsooth I thank thee<br>

That thou hast lik'd me to rescow;*                              *rescue<br>

And one avow to Love make I now,<br>

That all this May I will thy singer be."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02234">I thanked her, and was right *well apaid:*                    *satisfied<br>

"Yea," quoth she, "and be thou not dismay'd,<br>

Though thou have heard the cuckoo *erst than* me; &lt;6&gt;            *before<br>

For, if I live, it shall amended be<br>

The next May, if I be not afraid.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02235">"And one thing I will rede* thee also,<br>

Believe thou not the cuckoo, the love's foe,<br>

For all that he hath said is strong leasing."*                *falsehood<br>

"Nay," quoth I, "thereto shall nothing me bring<br>

For love, and it hath done me much woe."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02236">"Yea? Use," quoth she, "this medicine,<br>

Every day this May ere thou dine:<br>

Go look upon the fresh daisy,<br>

And, though thou be for woe in point to die,<br>

That shall full greatly less thee of thy pine.*                  *sorrow<br>
</p>

<p id="id02237">"And look alway that thou be good and true,<br>

And I will sing one of my songes new<br>

For love of thee, as loud as I may cry:"<br>

And then she began this song full high:<br>

"I shrew* all them that be of love untrue."                       *curse<br>
</p>

<p id="id02238">And when she had sung it to the end,<br>

"Now farewell," quoth she, "for I must wend,*                        *go<br>

 And, God of Love, that can right well and may,<br>

As much joy sende thee this day,<br>

As any lover yet he ever send!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02239">Thus took the nightingale her leave of me.<br>

I pray to God alway with her be,<br>

And joy of love he send her evermore,<br>

And shield us from the cuckoo and his lore;<br>

For there is not so false a bird as he.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02240">Forth she flew, the gentle nightingale,<br>

To all the birdes that were in that dale,<br>

And got them all into a place in fere,*                        *together<br>

And besought them that they would hear<br>

Her disease,* and thus began her tale.              *distress, grievance<br>

<p id="id02241">"Ye witte* well, it is not for to hide,                            *know<br>

<p id="id02242">Then spake one bird for all, by one assent:<br>

"This matter asketh good advisement;<br>

<p id="id02264" style="margin-top: 2em">[In "The Assembly of Fowls" — which Chaucer's "Retractation"
describes as "The Book of Saint Valentine's Day, or of the
Parliament of Birds" — we are presented with a picture of the
mediaeval "Court of Love" far closer to the reality than we find
in Chaucer's poem which bears that express title. We have a
regularly constituted conclave or tribunal, under a president
whose decisions are final. A difficult question is proposed for
the consideration and judgment of the Court — the disputants
advancing and vindicating their claims in person. The attendants
upon the Court, through specially chosen mouthpieces, deliver
their opinions on the cause; and finally a decision is
authoritatively pronounced by the president — which, as in
many of the cases actually judged before the Courts of Love in
France, places the reasonable and modest wish of a sensitive
and chaste lady above all the eagerness of her lovers, all the
incongruous counsels of representative courtiers. So far,
therefore, as the poem reproduces the characteristic features of
procedure in those romantic Middle Age halls of amatory
justice, Chaucer's "Assembly of Fowls" is his real "Court of
Love;" for although, in the castle and among the courtiers of
Admetus and Alcestis, we have all the personages and
machinery necessary for one of those erotic contentions, in the
present poem we see the personages and the machinery actually
at work, upon another scene and under other guises. The
allegory which makes the contention arise out of the loves, and
proceed in the assembly, of the feathered race, is quite in
keeping with the fanciful yet nature-loving spirit of the poetry
of Chaucer's time, in which the influence of the Troubadours
was still largely present. It is quite in keeping, also, with the
principles that regulated the Courts, the purpose of which was
more to discuss and determine the proper conduct of love
affairs, than to secure conviction or acquittal, sanction or
reprobation, in particular cases — though the jurisdiction and
the judgments of such assemblies often closely concerned
individuals. Chaucer introduces us to his main theme through
the vestibule of a fancied dream — a method which be
repeatedly employs with great relish, as for instance in "The
House of Fame." He has spent the whole day over Cicero's
account of the Dream of Scipio (Africanus the Younger); and,
having gone to bed, he dreams that Africanus the Elder appears
to him — just as in the book he appeared to his namesake — and
carries him into a beautiful park, in which is a fair garden by a
river-side. Here the poet is led into a splendid temple, through a
crowd of courtiers allegorically representing the various
instruments, pleasures, emotions, and encouragements of Love;
and in the temple Venus herself is found, sporting with her
porter Richess. Returning into the garden, he sees the Goddess
of Nature seated on a hill of flowers; and before her are
assembled all the birds — for it is Saint Valentine's Day, when
every fowl chooses her mate. Having with a graphic touch
enumerated and described the principal birds, the poet sees that
on her hand Nature bears a female eagle of surpassing loveliness
and virtue, for which three male eagles advance contending
claims. The disputation lasts all day; and at evening the
assembled birds, eager to be gone with their mates, clamour for
a decision. The tercelet, the goose, the cuckoo, and the turtle —
for birds of prey, water-fowl, worm-fowl, and seed-fowl
respectively — pronounce their verdicts on the dispute, in
speeches full of character and humour; but Nature refers the
decision between the three claimants to the female eagle herself,
who prays that she may have a year's respite. Nature grants the
prayer, pronounces judgment accordingly, and dismisses the
assembly; and after a chosen choir has sung a roundel in honour
of the Goddess, all the birds fly away, and the poet awakes. It is
probable that Chaucer derived the idea of the poem from a
French source; Mr Bell gives the outline of a fabliau, of which
three versions existed, and in which a contention between two
ladies regarding the merits of their respective lovers, a knight
and a clerk, is decided by Cupid in a Court composed of birds,
which assume their sides according to their different natures.
Whatever the source of the idea, its management, and the whole
workmanship of the poem, especially in the more humorous
passages, are essentially Chaucer's own.]</p>

<p id="id02270">First telleth it, when Scipio was come<br>

<p id="id02271">Then telleth it, that from a starry place<br>

How Africane hath him Carthage y-shew'd,<br>

<p id="id02272">Then asked he,* if folk that here be dead       *i.e. the younger Scipio<br>

And how our present worldly lives' space<br>

That ev'ry star should come into his place,<br>

Where it was first; and all should *out of mind,*   *perish from memory*<br>

That in this world is done of all mankind.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02275">Then pray'd him Scipio, to tell him all<br>

The way to come into that Heaven's bliss;<br>

And he said: "First know thyself immortal,<br>

Till many a world be passed, *out of dread;*             *without doubt*<br>

That so desired to pronounce our need,*                         business<br>

Shall tell our tale;" and prayed God her speed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02343">And for those water-fowles then began<br>

The goose to speak. and in her cackeling<br>

She saide, "Peace, now! take keep* ev'ry man,                      *heed<br>

And hearken what reason I shall forth bring;<br>

My wit is sharp, I love no tarrying;<br>

I say I rede him, though he were my brother,<br>

But* she will love him, let him love another!"                   *unless<br>

<p id="id02344">"Lo! here a perfect reason of a goose!"<br>

Quoth the sperhawke.  "Never may she the!*                       *thrive<br>

Now, pardie: fool, yet were it bet* for thee                     *better<br>

It lies not in his wit, nor in his will,<br>

But sooth is said, a fool cannot be still."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02345">The laughter rose of gentle fowles all;<br>

And right anon the seed-fowls chosen had<br>

The turtle true, and gan her to them call,<br>

And prayed her to say the *soothe sad*                   *serious truth*<br>

Of this mattere, and asked what she rad;*                    *counselled<br>

And she answer'd, that plainly her intent<br>

She woulde show, and soothly what she meant.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02346">"Nay! God forbid a lover shoulde change!"<br>

The turtle said, and wax'd for shame all red:<br>

"Though that his lady evermore be strange,*                  *disdainful<br>

Yet let him serve her ay, till he be dead;<br>

For, sooth, I praise not the goose's rede*                      *counsel<br>

For, though she died, I would none other make;*                    *mate<br>

I will be hers till that the death me take."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02347">*"Well bourded!"* quoth the ducke, "by my hat!          *a pretty joke!*<br>

That men should loven alway causeless,<br>

<p id="id02348">"Now fy, churl!" quoth the gentle tercelet,<br>

"Out of the dunghill came that word aright;<br>

Thou canst not see which thing is well beset;<br>

Thou far'st by love, as owles do by light,—<br>

That she herself shall have her election<br>

Of whom her list, whoso be *wroth or blith;*             *angry or glad*<br>

This judge I, Nature, for* I may not lie                        *because<br>

This formel eagle spake in this degree:*                         *manner<br>

And said them thus, as ye shall after hear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02355">"To you speak I, ye tercels," quoth Nature;<br>

"Be of good heart, and serve her alle three;<br>

<p id="id02362" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to The Assembly of Fowls</p>

<p id="id02363" style="margin-top: 2em">1. "The Dream of Scipio" — "Somnium Scipionis" — occupies
most of the sixth book of Cicero's "Republic;" which, indeed, as
it has come down to us, is otherwise imperfect. Scipio
Africanus Minor is represented as relating a dream which he had
when, in B.C. 149, he went to Africa as military tribune to the
fourth legion. He had talked long and earnestly of his adoptive
grandfather with Massinissa, King of Numidia, the intimate
friend of the great Scipio; and at night his illustrious ancestor
appeared to him in a vision, foretold the overthrow of Carthage
and all his other triumphs, exhorted him to virtue and patriotism
by the assurance of rewards in the next world, and discoursed
to him concerning the future state and the immortality of the
soul. Macrobius, about AD. 500, wrote a Commentary upon the
"Somnium Scipionis," which was a favourite book in the Middle
Ages. See note 17 to The Nun's Priest's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02364">2. Y-nome: taken; past participle of "nime," from Anglo-Saxon,
"niman," to take.</p>

<p id="id02365">3. His grace: the favour which the gods would show him, in
delivering Carthage into his hands.</p>

<p id="id02366">4. "Vestra vero, quae dicitur, vita mors est." ("Truly, as is said,
your life is a death")</p>

<p id="id02367">5. The nine spheres are God, or the highest heaven, constraining
and containing all the others; the Earth, around which the
planets and the highest heaven revolve; and the seven planets:
the revolution of all producing the "music of the spheres."</p>

<p id="id02368">6. Clear: illustrious, noble; Latin, "clarus."</p>

<p id="id02369">7. The sicke mette he drinketh of the tun: The sick man dreams
that he drinks wine, as one in health.</p>

<p id="id02370">8. The significance of the poet's looking to the NNW is not
plain; his window may have faced that way.</p>

<p id="id02371">9. The idea of the twin gates, leading to the Paradise and the
Hell of lovers, may have been taken from the description of the
gates of dreams in the Odyssey and the Aeneid; but the iteration
of "Through me men go" far more directly suggests the legend
on Dante's gate of Hell:—</p>

<p id="id02372">Per me si va nella citta dolente,<br>

Per me si va nell' eterno dolore;<br>

Per me si va tra la perduta gente.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02373">("Through me is the way to the city of sorrow,<br>

Through me is the way to eternal suffering;<br>

Through me is the way of the lost people")<br>
</p>

<p id="id02374">The famous line, "Lasciate ogni speranza, voi che entrate" —
"All hope abandon, ye who enter here" — is evidently
paraphrased in Chaucer's words "Th'eschewing is the only
remedy;" that is, the sole hope consists in the avoidance of that
dismal gate.</p>

<p id="id02375">10. A powerful though homely description of torment; the
sufferers being represented as fish enclosed in a weir from
which all the water has been withdrawn.</p>

<p id="id02376">11. Compare with this catalogue raisonne of trees the ampler
list given by Spenser in "The Faerie Queen," book i. canto i. In
several instances, as in "the builder oak" and "the sailing pine,"
the later poet has exactly copied the words of the earlier.
The builder oak: In the Middle Ages the oak was as
distinctively the building timber on land, as it subsequently
became for the sea.
The pillar elm:  Spenser explains this in paraphrasing it into "the
vineprop elm" — because it was planted as a pillar or  prop to
the vine; it is called "the coffer unto carrain," or "carrion,"
because coffins for the dead were made from it.
The box, pipe tree: the box tree was used for making pipes or horns.
Holm: the holly, used for whip-handles.
The sailing fir: Because ships' masts and spars were made of its
wood.
The cypress death to plain: in Spenser's imitation, "the cypress
funeral."
The shooter yew: yew wood was used for bows.
The aspe for shaftes plain: of the aspen, or black poplar, arrows
were made.
The laurel divine: So called, either because it was Apollo's
tree — Horace says that Pindar is "laurea donandus Apollinari" ("to
be given Apollo's laurel") — or because the honour which it
signified, when placed on the head of a poet or conqueror, lifted
a man as it were into the rank of the gods.</p>

<p id="id02377">12. If Chaucer had any special trio of courtiers in his mind when
he excluded so many names, we may suppose them to be
Charms, Sorcery, and Leasings who, in The Knight's Tale, come
after Bawdry and Riches — to whom Messagerie (the carrying
of messages) and Meed (reward, bribe) may correspond.</p>

<p id="id02378">13. The dove was the bird sacred to Venus; hence Ovid
enumerates the peacock of Juno, Jove's armour bearing bird,
"Cythereiadasque columbas" ("And the Cythereian doves") —
"Metamorphoses. xv. 386</p>

<p id="id02379">14. Priapus:  fitly endowed with a place in the Temple of Love,
as being the embodiment of the principle of fertility in flocks
and the fruits of the earth. See note 23 to the Merchant's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02380">15. Ovid, in the "Fasti" (i. 433), describes the confusion of
Priapus when, in the night following a feast of sylvan and
Bacchic deities, the braying of the ass of Silenus wakened the
company to detect the god in a furtive amatory expedition.</p>

<p id="id02381">16. Hautain: haughty, lofty; French, "hautain."</p>

<p id="id02382">17. Well to my pay: Well to my satisfaction; from French,
"payer," to pay, satisfy; the same word often occurs, in the
phrases "well apaid," and "evil apaid."</p>

<p id="id02383">18. Valentia, in Spain, was famed for the fabrication of fine and
transparent stuffs.</p>

<p id="id02384">19. The obvious reference is to the proverbial "Sine Cerere et
Libero friget Venus," ("Love is frozen without freedom and
food") quoted in Terence, "Eunuchus," act iv. scene v.</p>

<p id="id02385">20. Cypride: Venus; called "Cypria," or "Cypris," from the
island of Cyprus, in which her worship was especially
celebrated.</p>

<p id="id02386">21. Callisto, daughter of Lycaon, was seduced by Jupiter,
turned into a bear by Diana, and placed afterwards, with her
son, as the Great Bear among the stars.
Atalanta challenged Hippomenes, a Boetian youth, to a race in
which the prize was her hand in marriage — the penalty of
failure, death by her hand. Venus gave Hippomenes three
golden apples, and he won by dropping them one at a time
because Atalanta stopped to pick them up.
Semiramis was Queen of Ninus, the mythical founder of
Babylon; Ovid mentions her, along with Lais, as a type of
voluptuousness, in his "Amores," 1.5, 11.
Canace, daughter of Aeolus, is named in the prologue to The
Man of Law's Tale as one of the ladies whose "cursed stories"
Chaucer refrained from writing. She loved her brother
Macareus, and was slain by her father.
Hercules was conquered by his love for Omphale, and spun
wool for her in a woman's dress, while she wore his lion's skin.
Biblis vainly pursued her brother Caunus with her love, till she
was changed to a fountain; Ovid, "Metamorphoses." lib. ix.
Thisbe and Pyramus: the Babylonian lovers, whose death,
through the error of Pyramus in fancying that a lion had slain his
mistress, forms the theme of the interlude in the "Midsummer
Night's Dream."
Sir Tristram was one of the most famous among the knights of
King Arthur, and La Belle Isoude was his mistress. Their story
is mixed up with the Arthurian romance; but it was also the
subject of separate treatment, being among the most popular of
the Middle Age legends.
Achilles is reckoned among Love's conquests, because,
according to some traditions, he loved Polyxena, the daughter
of Priam, who was promised to him if he consented to join the
Trojans; and, going without arms into Apollo's temple at
Thymbra, he was there slain by Paris.
Scylla: Love-stories are told of two maidens of this name; one
the daughter of Nisus, King of Megara, who, falling in love with
Minos when he besieged the city, slew  her father by pulling
out the golden hair which grew on the top of his head, and on
which  which his life and kingdom depended. Minos won the
city, but rejected her love in horror. The other Scylla, from
whom the rock opposite Charybdis was named, was a beautiful
maiden, beloved by the sea-god Glaucus, but changed into a
monster through the jealousy and enchantments of Circe.
The mother of Romulus:  Silvia, daughter and only living child
of Numitor, whom her uncle Amulius made a vestal virgin, to
preclude the possibility that his brother's descendants could
wrest from him the kingdom of Alba Longa. But the maiden
was violated by Mars as she went to bring water from a
fountain; she bore Romulus and Remus; and she was drowned
in the Anio, while the cradle with the children was carried down
the stream in safety to the Palatine Hill, where the she-wolf
adopted them.</p>

<p id="id02387">22. Prest: ready; French, "pret."</p>

<p id="id02388">23. Alanus de Insulis, a Sicilian poet and orator of the twelfth
century, who wrote a book "De Planctu Naturae" — "The
Complaint of Nature."</p>

<p id="id02389">24. The falcon was borne on the hand by the highest
personages, not merely in actual sport, but to be caressed and
petted, even on occasions of ceremony, Hence also it is called
the "gentle" falcon — as if its high birth and breeding gave it a
right to august society.</p>

<p id="id02390">25. The merlion: elsewhere in the same poem called "emerlon;"
French, "emerillon;" the merlin, a small hawk carried by ladies.</p>

<p id="id02391">26. The scorning jay: scorning humbler birds, out of pride of his
fine plumage.</p>

<p id="id02392">27. The false lapwing: full of stratagems and pretences to divert
approaching danger from the nest where her young ones are.</p>

<p id="id02393">28. The sparrow, Venus' son: Because sacred to Venus.</p>

<p id="id02394">29. Coming with the spring, the nightingale is charmingly said
to call forth the new leaves.</p>

<p id="id02395">30. Many-coloured wings, like those of peacocks, were often
given to angels in paintings of the Middle Ages; and in
accordance with this fashion Spenser represents the Angel that
guarded Sir Guyon ("Faerie Queen," book ii. canto vii.) as
having wings "decked with diverse plumes, like painted jay's."</p>

<p id="id02396">31. The pheasant, scorner of the cock by night:  The meaning of
this passage is not very plain; it has been supposed, however, to
refer to the frequent breeding of pheasants at night with
domestic poultry in the farmyard — thus scorning the sway of
the cock, its rightful monarch.</p>

<p id="id02397">32. The waker goose:  Chaucer evidently alludes to the passage
in Ovid describing the crow of Apollo, which rivalled the
spotless doves, "Nec servataris vigili Capitolia voce cederet
anseribus" — "nor would it yield (in whiteness) to the geese
destined with wakeful or vigilant voice to save the Capitol"
("Metam.," ii. 538) when about to be surprised by the Gauls in
a night attack.</p>

<p id="id02398">33. The cuckoo ever unkind: the significance of this epithet is
amply explained by the poem of "The Cuckoo and the
Nightingale."</p>

<p id="id02399">34. The drake, destroyer: of the ducklings — which, if not
prevented, he will kill wholesale.</p>

<p id="id02400">35. The stork is conspicuous for faithfulness to all family
obligations, devotion to its young, and care of its parent birds in
their old age. Mr Bell quotes from Bishop Stanley's "History of
Birds" a little story which peculiarly justifies the special
character Chaucer has given: —  "A French surgeon, at Smyrna,
wishing to procure a stork, and finding great difficulty, on
account of the extreme veneration in which they are held by the
Turks, stole all the eggs out of a nest, and replaced them with
those of a hen: in process of time the young chickens came
forth, much to the astonishment of Mr and Mrs Stork. In a
short time Mr S. went off, and was not seen for two or three
days, when he returned with an immense crowd of his
companions, who all assembled in the place, and formed a
circle, taking no notice of the numerous spectators whom so
unusual an occurrence had collected. Mrs Stork was brought
forward into the midst of the circle, and, after some
consultation, the whole flock fell upon her and tore her to
pieces; after which they immediately dispersed, and the nest was
entirely abandoned."</p>

<p id="id02401">36. The cormorant feeds upon fish, so voraciously, that when
the stomach is crammed it will often have the gullet and bill
likewise full, awaiting the digestion of the rest.</p>

<p id="id02402">37. So called from the evil omens supposed to be afforded by
their harsh cries.</p>

<p id="id02403">38. The fieldfare visits this country only in hard wintry weather.</p>

<p id="id02404">39. "Formel," strictly or originally applied to the female of the
eagle and hawk, is here used generally of the female of all birds;
"tercel" is the corresponding word applied to the male.</p>

<p id="id02405">40. Entriketh: entangles, ensnares; french, "intriguer," to
perplex; hence "intricate."</p>

<p id="id02406">41. Entremette him of: meddle with; French, ' entremettre," to
interfere.</p>

<p id="id02407">42. The duck exhorts the contending lovers to be of light heart

<p id="id02409">44. The cuckoo is distinguished by its habit of laying its eggs in
the nests of other and smaller birds, such as the hedge-sparrow
("heggsugg"); and its young, when hatched, throw the eggs or
nestlings of the true parent bird out of the nest, thus engrossing
the mother's entire care. The crime on which the emerlon
comments so sharply, is explained by the migratory habits of the
cuckoo, which prevent its bringing up its own young; and
nature has provided facilities for the crime, by furnishing the
young bird with a peculiarly strong and broad back, indented by
a hollow in which the sparrow's egg is lifted till it is thrown out
of the nest.</p>

<h3 id="id02411" style="margin-top: 3em">                     THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF</h3>

<p id="id02412" style="margin-top: 2em">["The Flower and the Leaf" is pre-eminently one of those
poems by which Chaucer may be triumphantly defended against
the charge of licentious coarseness, that, founded upon his
faithful representation of the manners, customs, and daily life
and speech of his own time, in "The Canterbury Tales," are
sweepingly advanced against his works at large. In an allegory —
rendered perhaps somewhat cumbrous by the detail of chivalric
ceremonial, and the heraldic minuteness, which entered so liberally
into poetry, as into the daily life of the classes for whom poetry
was then written — Chaucer beautifully enforces the lasting
advantages of purity, valour, and faithful love, and the fleeting
and disappointing character of mere idle pleasure, of sloth
and listless retirement from the battle of life. In the
"season sweet" of spring, which the great singer of Middle Age
England loved so well, a gentle woman is supposed to seek
sleep in vain, to rise "about the springing of the gladsome day,"
and, by an unfrequented path in a pleasant grove, to arrive at an
arbour. Beside the arbour stands a medlar-tree, in which a
Goldfinch sings passing sweetly; and the Nightingale answers
from a green laurel tree, with so merry and ravishing a note,
that the lady resolves to proceed no farther, but sit down on the
grass to listen. Suddenly the sound of many voices singing
surprises her; and she sees "a world of ladies" emerge from a
grove, clad in white, and wearing garlands of laurel, of agnus
castus, and woodbind. One, who wears a crown and bears a
branch of agnus castus in her hand, begins a roundel, in honour
of the Leaf, which all the others take up, dancing and singing in
the meadow before the arbour. Soon, to the sound of
thundering trumps, and attended by a splendid and warlike
retinue, enter nine knights, in white, crowned like the ladies;
and after they have jousted an hour and more, they alight and
advance to the ladies. Each dame takes a knight by the hand;
and all incline reverently to the laurel tree, which they
encompass, singing of love, and dancing. Soon, preceded by a
band of minstrels, out of the open field comes a lusty company
of knights and ladies in green, crowned with chaplets of
flowers; and they do reverence to a tuft of flowers in the middle
of the meadow, while one of their number sings a bergerette in
praise of the daisy. But now it is high noon; the sun waxes
fervently hot; the flowers lose their beauty, and wither with the
heat; the ladies in green are scorched, the knights faint for lack
of shade. Then a strong wind beats down all the flowers, save
such as are protected by the leaves of hedges and groves; and a
mighty storm of rain and hail drenches the ladies and knights,
shelterless in the now flowerless meadow. The storm overpast,
the company in white, whom the laurel-tree has safely shielded
from heat and storm, advance to the relief of the others; and
when their clothes have been dried, and their wounds from sun
and storm healed, all go together to sup with the Queen in
white — on whose hand, as they pass by the arbour, the
Nightingale perches, while the Goldfinch flies to the Lady of the
Flower. The pageant gone, the gentlewoman quits the arbour,
and meets a lady in white, who, at her request, unfolds the
hidden meaning of all that she has seen; "which," says Speght
quaintly, "is this: They which honour the Flower, a thing fading
with every blast, are such as look after beauty and worldly
pleasure. But they that honour the Leaf, which abideth with the
root, notwithstanding the frosts and winter storms, are they
which follow Virtue and during qualities, without regard of
worldly respects." Mr Bell, in his edition, has properly noticed
that there is no explanation of the emblematical import of the
medlar-tree, the goldfinch, and the nightingale. "But," he says,
"as the fruit of the medlar, to use Chaucer's own expression (see
Prologue to the Reeve's Tale), is rotten before it is ripe, it may
be the emblem of sensual pleasure, which palls before it confers
real enjoyment. The goldfinch is remarkable for the beauty of its
plumage, the sprightliness of its movements, and its gay,
tinkling song, and may be supposed to represent the showy and
unsubstantial character of frivolous pleasures. The nightingale's
sober outward appearance and impassioned song denote greater
depth of feeling." The poem throughout is marked by the purest
and loftiest moral tone; and it amply deserved Dryden's special
recommendation, "both for the invention and the moral." It is
given without abridgement.]

not the author of this poem)</p>

A mighty spear, full sharp y-ground and keen;<br>

And ev'ry childe* ware of leaves green                             *page<br>
</p>

<p id="id02449">A freshe chaplet on his haires bright;<br>

And cloakes white of fine velvet they ware<br>

Their steedes trapped and arrayed right,<br>

Without difference, as their lordes' were;<br>

And after them, on many a fresh courser,<br>

There came of armed knightes such a rout,*               *company, crowd<br>

That they bespread the large field about.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02450">And all they waren, after their degrees,<br>

Chapelets newe made of laurel green,<br>

Some of the oak, and some of other trees;<br>

Some in their handes bare boughes sheen,*                        *bright<br>

Some of laurel, and some of oakes keen,<br>

Some of hawthorn, and some of the woodbind,<br>

And many more which I had not in mind.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02451">And so they came, their horses fresh stirring<br>

With bloody soundes of their trumpets loud;<br>

There saw I many an *uncouth disguising*           *strange manoeuvring*<br>

In the array of these knightes proud;<br>

And at the last, as evenly as they could,<br>

They took their place in middest of the mead,<br>

And ev'ry knight turned his horse's head<br>
</p>

<p id="id02452">To his fellow, and lightly laid a spear<br>

Into the rest; and so the jousts began<br>

On ev'ry part aboute, here and there;<br>

Some brake his spear, some threw down horse and man;<br>

About the field astray the steedes ran;<br>

And, to behold their rule and governance,*                      *conduct<br>

I you ensure, it was a great pleasuance.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02453">And so the joustes last'* an hour and more;                      *lasted<br>

But those that crowned were in laurel green<br>

Wonne the prize; their dintes* were so sore,                    *strokes<br>

That there was none against them might sustene:<br>

And the jousting was alle left off clean,<br>

And from their horse the nine alight' anon,<br>

And so did all the remnant ev'ry one.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02454">And forth they went together, twain and twain,<br>

That to behold it was a worthy sight,<br>

Toward the ladies on the greene plain,<br>

That sang and danced as I said now right;<br>

The ladies, as soon as they goodly might,<br>

They brake off both the song and eke the dance,<br>

And went to meet them with full glad semblance.*            *air, aspect<br>
</p>

<p id="id02455">And ev'ry lady took, full womanly,<br>

By th'hand a knight, and so forth right they yede*                 *went<br>

Unto a fair laurel that stood fast by,<br>

With leaves lade the boughs of greate brede;*                   *breadth<br>

And, to my doom,* there never was, indeed,                     *judgment<br>

Man that had seene half so fair a tree;<br>

For underneath it there might well have be*                        *been<br>
</p>

<p id="id02456">A hundred persons, *at their own pleasance,*        *in perfect comfort*<br>

Shadowed from the heat of Phoebus bright,<br>

So that they shoulde have felt no grievance*                  *annoyance<br>

Of rain nor haile that them hurte might.<br>

The savour eke rejoice would any wight<br>

That had been sick or melancholious,<br>

It was so very good and virtuous.*              *full of healing virtues<br>
</p>

<p id="id02457">And with great rev'rence they inclined low<br>

Unto the tree so sweet and fair of hue;*                     *appearance<br>

And after that, within a *little throw,*                    *short time*<br>

They all began to sing and dance of new,<br>

Some song of love, some *plaining of untrue,*              *complaint of<br>

Environing* the tree that stood upright;                 unfaithfulness*<br>

And ever went a lady and a knight.                          *going round<br>
</p>

<p id="id02458">And at the last I cast mine eye aside,<br>

And was ware of a lusty company<br>

That came roaming out of the fielde wide;<br>

[And] hand in hand a knight and a lady;<br>

The ladies all in surcoats, that richly<br>

Purfiled* were with many a riche stone;          *trimmed at the borders<br>

And ev'ry knight of green ware mantles on,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02459">Embroider'd well, so as the surcoats were;<br>

And ev'reach had a chaplet on her head<br>

(Which did right well upon the shining hair),<br>

Maked of goodly flowers, white and red.<br>

The knightes eke, that they in hande led,<br>

In suit of them ware chaplets ev'ry one,<br>

And them before went minstrels many one,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02460">As harpes, pipes, lutes, and psaltry,<br>

All [clad] in green; and, on their heades bare,<br>

Of divers flowers, made full craftily<br>

All in a suit, goodly chaplets they ware;<br>

And so dancing into the mead they fare.<br>

In mid the which they found a tuft that was<br>

All overspread with flowers in compass*             *around, in a circle<br>
</p>

<p id="id02461">Whereunto they inclined ev'ry one,<br>

With great reverence, and that full humbly<br>

And at the last there then began anon<br>

A lady for to sing right womanly,<br>

A bargaret, &lt;14&gt; in praising the daisy.<br>

For, as me thought, among her notes sweet,<br>

She saide: "Si douce est la margarete."&lt;15&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02462">Then alle they answered her in fere*                           *together<br>

So passingly well, and so pleasantly,<br>

That it was a [most] blissful noise to hear.<br>

But, I n'ot* how, it happen'd suddenly                         *know not<br>

As about noon the sun so fervently<br>

Wax'd hote, that the pretty tender flow'rs<br>

Had lost the beauty of their fresh colours,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02463">Forshrunk* with heat; the ladies eke to-brent,**	*shrivelled **very burnt<br>

That they knew not where they might them bestow;<br>

The knightes swelt,* for lack of shade nigh shent**	*fainted **destroyed<br>

And after that, within a little throw,<br>

The wind began so sturdily to blow,<br>

That down went all the flowers ev'ry one,<br>

So that in all the mead there left not one;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02464">Save such as succour'd were among the leaves<br>

From ev'ry storm that mighte them assail,<br>

Growing under the hedges and thick greves;*              *groves, boughs<br>

And after that there came a storm of hail<br>

And rain in fere,* so that withoute fail                       *together<br>

The ladies nor the knights had not one thread<br>

Dry on them, so dropping was [all] their weed.*                *clothing<br>
</p>

<p id="id02465">And when the storm was passed clean away,<br>

Those in the white, that stood under the tree,<br>

They felt no thing of all the great affray<br>

That they in green without *had in y-be:*                  *had been in*<br>

To them they went for ruth, and for pity,<br>

Them to comfort after their great disease;*                     *trouble<br>

So fain* they were the helpless for to ease.                *glad, eager<br>
</p>

<p id="id02466">Then I was ware how one of them in green<br>

Had on a crowne, rich and well sitting;*                       *becoming<br>

Wherefore I deemed well she was a queen,<br>

And those in green on her were awaiting.*                 *in attendance<br>

The ladies then in white that were coming<br>

Toward them, and the knightes eke *in fere,*                  *together*<br>

Began to comfort them, and make them cheer.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02467">The queen in white, that was of great beauty,<br>

Took by the hand the queen that was in green,<br>

And saide: "Sister, I have great pity<br>

Of your annoy, and of your troublous teen,*               *injury, grief<br>

Wherein you and your company have been<br>

So long, alas! and if that it you please<br>

To go with me, I shall you do the ease,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02468">"In all the pleasure that I can or may;"<br>

Whereof the other, humbly as she might,<br>

Thanked her; for in right evil array<br>

She was, with storm and heat, I you behight;*                    *assure<br>

Arid ev'ry lady then anon aright,<br>

That were in white, one of them took in green<br>

By the hand; which when that the knights had seen,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02469">In like mannere each of them took a knight<br>

Y-clad in green, and forth with them they fare<br>

Unto a hedge, where that they anon right,<br>

To make their joustes,&lt;16&gt; they would not spare<br>

Boughes to hewe down, and eke trees square,<br>

Wherewith they made them stately fires great,<br>

To dry their clothes, that were wringing wet.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02470">And after that, of herbes that there grew,<br>

They made, for blisters of the sun's burning,<br>

Ointmentes very good, wholesome, and new,<br>

Wherewith they went the sick fast anointing;<br>

And after that they went about gath'ring<br>

Pleasant salades, which they made them eat,<br>

For to refresh their great unkindly heat.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02471">The Lady of the Leaf then gan to pray<br>

Her of the Flower (for so, to my seeming,<br>

They should be called, as by their array),<br>

To sup with her; and eke, for anything,<br>

That she should with her all her people bring;<br>

And she again in right goodly mannere<br>

Thanked her fast of her most friendly cheer;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02472">Saying plainely, that she would obey,<br>

With all her heart, all her commandement:<br>

And then anon, without longer delay,<br>

The Lady of the Leaf hath one y-sent<br>

To bring a palfrey, *after her intent,*          *according to her wish*<br>

Arrayed well in fair harness of gold;<br>

For nothing lack'd, that *to him longe sho'ld.*   *should belong to him*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02473">And, after that, to all her company<br>

She made to purvey* horse and ev'rything                        *provide<br>

That they needed; and then full lustily,<br>

Ev'n by the arbour where I was sitting,<br>

They passed all, so merrily singing,<br>

That it would have comforted any wight.<br>

But then I saw a passing wondrous sight;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02474">For then the nightingale, that all the day<br>

Had in the laurel sat, and did her might<br>

The whole service to sing longing to May,<br>

All suddenly began to take her flight;<br>

And to the Lady of the Leaf forthright<br>

She flew, and set her on her hand softly;<br>

Which was a thing I marvell'd at greatly.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02475">The goldfinch eke, that from the medlar tree<br>

Was fled for heat into the bushes cold,<br>

Unto the Lady of the Flower gan flee,<br>

And on her hand he set him as he wo'ld,<br>

And pleasantly his winges gan to fold;<br>

And for to sing they *pain'd them* both, as sore  *made great exertions*<br>

As they had done *of all* the day before.                        *during<br>
</p>

<p id="id02476">And so these ladies rode forth *a great pace,*                 *rapidly*<br>

And all the rout of knightes eke in fere;<br>

And I, that had seen all this *wonder case,*         *wondrous incident*<br>

Thought that I would assay in some mannere<br>

To know fully the truth of this mattere,<br>

And what they were that rode so pleasantly;<br>

And when they were the arbour passed by,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02477">I *dress'd me forth,* and happ'd to meet anon             *issued forth*<br>

A right fair lady, I do you ensure;*                             *assure<br>

And she came riding by herself alone,<br>

All in white; [then] with semblance full demure<br>

I her saluted, and bade good adventure*                         *fortune<br>

Might her befall, as I could most humbly;<br>

And she answer'd: "My daughter, gramercy!"*           *great thanks &lt;17&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02478">"Madame," quoth I, "if that I durst enquere<br>

Of you, I would fain, of that company,<br>

Wit what they be that pass'd by this herbere?<br>

And she again answered right friendly:<br>

"My faire daughter, all that pass'd hereby<br>

In white clothing, be servants ev'ry one<br>

Unto the Leaf; and I myself am one.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02479">"See ye not her that crowned is," quoth she<br>

"[Clad] all in white?" — "Madame," then quoth I, "yes:"<br>

"That is Dian', goddess of chastity;<br>

And for because that she a maiden is,<br>

In her hande the branch she beareth this,<br>

That agnus castus &lt;8&gt; men call properly;<br>

And all the ladies in her company,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02480">"Which ye see of that herbe chaplets wear,<br>

Be such as have kept alway maidenhead:<br>

And all they that of laurel chaplets bear,<br>

Be such as hardy* were in manly deed,  —                    *courageous<br>

Victorious name which never may be dead!<br>

And all they were so *worthy of their hand*           *valiant in fight*<br>

In their time, that no one might them withstand,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02481">"And those that weare chaplets on their head<br>

Of fresh woodbind, be such as never were<br>

To love untrue in word, in thought, nor deed,<br>

But ay steadfast; nor for pleasance, nor fear,<br>

Though that they should their heartes all to-tear,*     *rend in pieces*<br>

Would never flit,* but ever were steadfast,                      *change<br>

*Till that their lives there asunder brast."*           *till they died*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02482">"Now fair Madame," quoth I, "yet would I pray<br>

Your ladyship, if that it mighte be,<br>

That I might knowe, by some manner way<br>

(Since that it hath liked your beauty,<br>

The truth of these ladies for to tell me),<br>

What that these knightes be in rich armour,<br>

And what those be in green and wear the flow'r?<br>
</p>

<p id="id02483">"And why that some did rev'rence to that tree,<br>

And some unto the plot of flowers fair?"<br>

"With right good will, my daughter fair," quoth she,<br>

"Since your desire is good and debonair;*             *gentle, courteous<br>

The nine crowned be *very exemplair*                 *the true examples*<br>

Of all honour longing to chivalry;<br>

And those certain be call'd The Nine Worthy, &lt;18&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02484">"Which ye may see now riding all before,<br>

That in their time did many a noble deed,<br>

And for their worthiness full oft have bore<br>

The crown of laurel leaves upon their head,<br>

As ye may in your olde bookes read;<br>

And how that he that was a conquerour<br>

Had by laurel alway his most honour.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02485">"And those that beare boughes in their hand<br>

Of the precious laurel so notable,<br>

Be such as were, I will ye understand,<br>

Most noble Knightes of the Rounde Table,&lt;19&gt;<br>

And eke the Douceperes honourable; &lt;20&gt;<br>

Whiche they bear in sign of victory,<br>

As witness of their deedes mightily.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02486">"Eke there be knightes old &lt;21&gt; of the Garter,<br>

That in their time did right worthily;<br>

And the honour they did to the laurer*                      *laurel &lt;22&gt;<br>

Is for* by it they have their laud wholly,                      *because<br>

Their triumph eke, and martial glory;<br>

Which unto them is more perfect richess<br>

Than any wight imagine can, or guess.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02487">"For one leaf given of that noble tree<br>

To any wight that hath done worthily,<br>

An'* it be done so as it ought to be,                                *if<br>

Is more honour than any thing earthly;<br>

Witness of Rome, that founder was truly<br>

Of alle knighthood and deeds marvellous;<br>

Record I take of Titus Livius." &lt;23&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02488">And as for her that crowned is in green,<br>

It is Flora, of these flowers goddess;<br>

And all that here on her awaiting be'n,<br>

It are such folk that loved idleness,<br>

And not delighted in no business,<br>

But for to hunt and hawk, and play in meads,<br>

And many other such-like idle deeds.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02489">"And for the great delight and the pleasance<br>

They have to the flow'r, and so rev'rently<br>

They unto it do such obeisance<br>

As ye may see." "Now, fair Madame,"quoth I,<br>

"If I durst ask, what is the cause, and why,<br>

That knightes have the ensign* of honour                       *insignia<br>

Rather by the leaf than by the flow'r?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02490">"Soothly, daughter," quoth she, "this is the troth:<br>

For knights should ever be persevering,<br>

To seek honour, without feintise* or sloth,               *dissimulation<br>

From well to better in all manner thing:<br>

In sign of which, with leaves aye lasting<br>

They be rewarded after their degree,<br>

Whose lusty green may not appaired* be,               *impaired, decayed<br>
</p>

<p id="id02491">"But ay keeping their beauty fresh and green;<br>

For there is no storm that may them deface,<br>

Nor hail nor snow, nor wind nor frostes keen;<br>

Wherefore they have this property and grace:<br>

And for the flow'r, within a little space,<br>

Wolle* be lost, so simple of nature                                *will<br>

They be, that they no grievance* may endure;           *injury, hardship<br>
</p>

<p id="id02492">"And ev'ry storm will blow them soon away,<br>

Nor they laste not but for a season;<br>

That is the cause, the very truth to say,<br>

That they may not, by no way of reason,<br>

Be put to no such occupation."<br>

"Madame," quoth I, "with all my whole service<br>

I thank you now, in my most humble wise;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02493">"For now I am ascertain'd thoroughly<br>

Of ev'ry thing that I desir'd to know."<br>

"I am right glad that I have said, soothly,<br>

Aught to your pleasure, if ye will me trow,"*                   *believe<br>

Quoth she again; "but to whom do ye owe<br>

Your service? and which wolle* ye honour,                          *will<br>

Tell me, I pray, this year, the Leaf or the Flow'r?"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02494">"Madame," quoth I, "though I be least worthy,<br>

Unto the Leaf I owe mine observance:"<br>

"That is," quoth she, "right well done, certainly;<br>

And I pray God, to honour you advance,<br>

And keep you from the wicked remembrance<br>

Of Malebouche,* and all his cruelty;                       *Slander &lt;24&gt;<br>

<p id="id02495">"For here may I no longer now abide;<br>

I took my leave of her, and she gan hie*                          *haste<br>

<h3 id="id02525" style="margin-top: 3em">                       THE HOUSE OF FAME</h3>

<p id="id02526" style="margin-top: 2em">[Thanks partly to Pope's brief and elegant paraphrase, in his
"Temple of Fame," and partly to the familiar force of the style
and the satirical significance of the allegory, "The House of
Fame" is among the best known and relished of Chaucer's minor
poems. The octosyllabic measure in which it is written — the
same which the author of "Hudibras" used with such admirable
effect — is excellently adapted for the vivid descriptions, the
lively sallies of humour and sarcasm, with which the poem
abounds; and when the poet actually does get to his subject, he
treats it with a zest, and a corresponding interest on the part of
the reader, which are scarcely surpassed by the best of The
Canterbury Tales. The poet, however, tarries long on the way
to the House of Fame; as Pope says in his advertisement, the
reader who would compare his with Chaucer's poem, "may
begin with [Chaucer's] third Book of Fame, there being nothing
in the two first books that answers to their title." The first book
opens with a kind of prologue (actually so marked and called in
earlier editions) in which the author speculates on the causes of
dreams; avers that never any man had such a dream as he had
on the tenth of December; and prays the God of Sleep to help
him to interpret the dream, and the Mover of all things to
reward or afflict those readers who take the dream well or ill.
Then he relates that, having fallen asleep, he fancied himself
within a temple of glass — the abode of Venus — the walls of
which were painted with the story of Aeneas. The paintings are
described at length; and then the poet tells us that, coming out
of the temple, he found himself on a vast sandy plain, and saw
high in heaven an eagle, that began to descend towards him.
With the prologue, the first book numbers 508 lines; of which
192 only — more than are actually concerned with or directly
lead towards the real subject of the poem — are given here. The
second book, containing 582 lines, of which 176 will be found
in this edition, is wholly devoted to the voyage from the Temple
of Venus to the House of Fame, which the dreamer
accomplishes in the eagle's claws. The bird has been sent by
Jove to do the poet some "solace" in reward of his labours for
the cause of Love; and during the transit through the air the
messenger discourses obligingly and learnedly with his human
burden on the theory of sound, by which all that is spoken must
needs reach the House of Fame; and on other matters suggested
by their errand and their observations by the way. The third
book (of 1080 lines, only a score of which, just at the outset,
have been omitted) brings us to the real pith of the poem. It
finds the poet close to the House of Fame, built on a rock of ice
engraved with names, many of which are half-melted away.
Entering the gorgeous palace, he finds all manner of minstrels
and historians; harpers, pipers, and trumpeters of fame;
magicians, jugglers, sorcerers, and many others. On a throne of
ruby sits the goddess, seeming at one moment of but a cubit's
stature, at the next touching heaven; and at either hand, on
pillars, stand the great authors who "bear up the name" of
ancient nations. Crowds of people enter the hall from all regions
of earth, praying the goddess to give them good or evil fame,
with and without their own deserts; and they receive answers
favourable, negative, or contrary, according to the caprice of
Fame. Pursuing his researches further, out of the region of
reputation or fame proper into that of tidings or rumours, the
poet is led, by a man who has entered into conversation with
him, to a vast whirling house of twigs, ever open to the arrival
of tidings, ever full of murmurings, whisperings, and clatterings,
coming from the vast crowds that fill it — for every rumour,
every piece of news, every false report, appears there in the
shape of the person who utters it, or passes it on, down in earth.
Out at the windows innumerable, the tidings pass to Fame, who
gives to each report its name and duration; and in the house
travellers, pilgrims, pardoners, couriers, lovers, &amp;c., make a
huge clamour. But here the poet meets with a man "of great
authority," and, half afraid, awakes; skilfully  — whether by
intention, fatigue, or accident — leaving the reader disappointed
by the nonfulfilment of what seemed to be promises of further
disclosures. The poem, not least in the passages the omission of
which has been dictated by the exigencies of the present
volume, is full of testimony to the vast acquaintance of Chaucer
with learning ancient and modern; Ovid, Virgil, Statius, are
equally at his command to illustrate his narrative or to furnish
the ground-work of his descriptions; while architecture, the
Arabic numeration, the theory of sound, and the effects of
gunpowder, are only a few among the topics of his own time of
which the poet treats with the ease of proficient knowledge.
Not least interesting are the vivid touches in which Chaucer
sketches the routine of his laborious and almost recluse daily
life; while the strength, individuality, and humour that mark the
didactic portion of the poem prove that "The House of Fame"
was one of the poet's riper productions.]</p>

to the description; but they merely embody Virgil's account of
Aeneas' adventures from the destruction of Troy to his arrival in
Italy; and the only characteristic passage is the following
reflection, suggested by the death of Dido for her perfidious but
fate-compelled guest:</p>

<p id="id02531">Lo! how a woman doth amiss,<br>

<p id="id02536">The poet faints through bewilderment and fear; but the eagle,
speaking with the voice of a man, recalls him to himself, and
comforts him by the assurance that what now befalls him is for
his instruction and profit. Answering the poet's unspoken
inquiry whether he is not to die otherwise, or whether Jove will
him stellify, the eagle says that he has been sent by Jupiter out
of his "great ruth,"</p>

<p id="id02537">"For that thou hast so truely<br>

That no tidings come to thee,<br>

House of Fame, to do him some pleasure in recompense for his
devotion to Cupid; and he will hear, says the bird,</p>

<p id="id02540">The poet can scarcely believe that, though Fame had all the pies
[magpies] and all the spies in a kingdom, she should hear so
much; but the eagle proceeds to prove that she can.</p>

<p id="id02541">First shalt thou heare where she dwelleth;<br>

And, so as thine own booke telleth, &lt;16&gt;<br>

Her palace stands, as I shall say,<br>

Right ev'n in middes of the way<br>

Betweene heav'n, and earth, and sea,<br>

That whatsoe'er in all these three<br>

Is spoken, *privy or apert,*                        *secretly or openly*<br>

The air thereto is so overt,*                                     *clear<br>

Certain *it must thither need."*              *it must needs go thither*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02542">The eagle, in a long discourse, demonstrates that, as all natural
things have a natural place towards which they move by natural
inclination, and as sound is only broken air, so every sound
must come to Fame's House, "though it were piped of a mouse"
— on the same principle by which every part of a mass of water
is affected by the casting in of a stone. The poet is all the while
borne upward, entertained with various information by the bird;
which at last cries out —</p>

"What?" quoth I. "The greate soun',"<br>

"Peter! the beating of the sea,"<br>

<p id="id02545">At the opening of the Third Book, Chaucer briefly invokes
Apollo's guidance, and entreats him, because "the rhyme is light
and lewd," to "make it somewhat agreeable, though some verse
fail in a syllable." If the god answers the prayer, the poet
promises to kiss the next laurel-tree &lt;18&gt; he sees; and he
proceeds:</p>

There saw I the queen Medea, &lt;42&gt;<br>

And Circes &lt;43&gt; eke, and Calypsa.&lt;44&gt;<br>

There saw I Hermes Ballenus, &lt;45&gt;<br>

Limote, &lt;46&gt; and eke Simon Magus. &lt;47&gt;<br>

There saw I, and knew by name,<br>

That by such art do men have fame.<br>

There saw I Colle Tregetour &lt;46&gt;<br>

Upon a table of sycamore<br>

Play an uncouth* thing to tell;                           *strange, rare<br>

I saw him carry a windmell<br>

Under a walnut shell.<br>

Why should I make longer tale<br>

Of all the people I there say,*                                     *saw<br>

From hence even to doomesday?<br>
</p>

<p id="id02551">When I had all this folk behold,<br>

And found me *loose, and not y-hold,*      *at liberty and unrestrained*<br>

And I had mused longe while<br>

Upon these walles of beryle,<br>

That shone lighter than any glass,<br>

And made *well more* than it was                           *much greater<br>

To seemen ev'rything, y-wis,<br>

As kindly* thing of Fame it is; &lt;48&gt;                            *natural<br>

I gan forth roam until I fand*                                    *found<br>

The castle-gate on my right hand,<br>

Which all so well y-carven was,<br>

That never such another n'as;*                                  *was not<br>

And yet it was by Adventure*                                     *chance<br>

Y-wrought, and not by *subtile cure.*                      *careful art*<br>

It needeth not you more to tell,<br>

To make you too longe dwell,<br>

Of these gates' flourishings,<br>

Nor of compasses,* nor carvings,                                *devices<br>

Nor how they had in masonries,<br>

As corbets, &lt;49&gt; full of imageries.<br>

But, Lord! so fair it was to shew,<br>

For it was all with gold behew.*                               *coloured<br>

But in I went, and that anon;<br>

There met I crying many a one<br>

"A largess! largess! &lt;50&gt; hold up well!<br>

God save the Lady of this pell,*                                 *palace<br>

Our owen gentle Lady Fame,<br>

And them that will to have name<br>

Of us!" Thus heard I cryen all,<br>

And fast they came out of the hall,<br>

And shooke *nobles and sterlings,*                           *coins &lt;51&gt;<br>

And some y-crowned were as kings,<br>

With crownes wrought fall of lozenges;<br>

And many ribands, and many fringes,<br>

Were on their clothes truely<br>

Then at the last espied I<br>

That pursuivantes and herauds,*                                 *heralds<br>

That cry riche folke's lauds,*                                  *praises<br>

They weren all; and ev'ry man<br>

Of them, as I you telle can,<br>

Had on him throwen a vesture<br>

Which that men call a coat-armure, &lt;52&gt;<br>

Embroidered wondrously rich,<br>

As though there were *naught y-lich;*                  *nothing like it*<br>

But naught will I, so may I thrive,<br>

*Be aboute to descrive*                 *concern myself with describing*<br>

All these armes that there were,<br>

That they thus on their coates bare,<br>

For it to me were impossible;<br>

Men might make of them a bible<br>

Twenty foote thick, I trow.<br>

For, certain, whoso coulde know<br>

Might there all the armes see'n<br>

Of famous folk that have been<br>

In Afric', Europe, and Asie,<br>

Since first began the chivalry.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02552">Lo! how should I now tell all this?<br>

Nor of the hall eke what need is<br>

To telle you that ev'ry wall<br>

Of it, and floor, and roof, and all,<br>

Was plated half a foote thick<br>

Of gold, and that was nothing wick',*                       *counterfeit<br>

But for to prove in alle wise<br>

As fine as ducat of Venise, &lt;53&gt;<br>

Of which too little in my pouch is?<br>

And they were set as thick of nouches*                        *ornaments<br>

Fine, of the finest stones fair,<br>

That men read in the Lapidaire, &lt;54&gt;<br>

As grasses growen in a mead.<br>

But it were all too long to read*                               *declare<br>

The names; and therefore I pass.<br>

But in this rich and lusty place,<br>

That Fame's Hall y-called was,<br>

Full muche press of folk there n'as,*                           *was not<br>

Nor crowding for too muche press.<br>

But all on high, above a dais,<br>

Set on a see* imperial, &lt;55&gt;                                       *seat<br>

That made was of ruby all,<br>

Which that carbuncle is y-call'd,<br>

I saw perpetually install'd<br>

A feminine creature;<br>

That never formed by Nature<br>

Was such another thing y-sey.*                                     *seen<br>

For altherfirst,* sooth to say,                            *first of all<br>

Me thoughte that she was so lite,*                               *little<br>

That the length of a cubite<br>

Was longer than she seem'd to be;<br>

But thus soon in a while she<br>

Herself then wonderfully stretch'd,<br>

That with her feet the earth she reach'd,<br>

And with her head she touched heaven,<br>

Where as shine the starres seven. &lt;56&gt;<br>

And thereto* eke, as to my wit,                                *moreover<br>

I saw a greater wonder yet,<br>

Upon her eyen to behold;<br>

But certes I them never told.<br>

For *as fele eyen* hadde she,                             *as many eyes*<br>

As feathers upon fowles be,<br>

Or were on the beastes four<br>

That Godde's throne gan honour,<br>

As John writ in th'Apocalypse. &lt;57&gt;<br>

Her hair, that *oundy was and crips,*              *wavy &lt;58&gt; and crisp*<br>

As burnish'd gold it shone to see;<br>

And, sooth to tellen, also she<br>

Had all so fele* upstanding ears,                                  *many<br>

And tongues, as on beasts be hairs;<br>

And on her feet waxen saw I<br>

Partridges' winges readily.&lt;59&gt;<br>

But, Lord! the pierrie* and richess                     *gems, jewellery<br>

I saw sitting on this goddess,<br>

And the heavenly melody<br>

Of songes full of harmony,<br>

I heard about her throne y-sung,<br>

That all the palace walles rung!<br>

(So sung the mighty Muse, she<br>

That called is Calliope,<br>

And her eight sisteren* eke,                                    *sisters<br>

That in their faces seeme meek);<br>

And evermore eternally<br>

They sang of Fame as then heard I:<br>

"Heried* be thou and thy name,                                  *praised<br>

Goddess of Renown and Fame!"<br>

Then was I ware, lo! at the last,<br>

As I mine eyen gan upcast,<br>

That this ilke noble queen<br>

On her shoulders gan sustene*                                   *sustain<br>

Both the armes, and the name<br>

Of those that hadde large fame;<br>

Alexander, and Hercules,<br>

That with a shirt his life lese.* &lt;60&gt;                             *lost<br>

Thus found I sitting this goddess,<br>

In noble honour and richess;<br>

Of which I stint* a while now,                  *refrain (from speaking)<br>

Of other things to telle you.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02553">Then saw I stand on either side,<br>

Straight down unto the doores wide,<br>

From the dais, many a pillere<br>

Of metal, that shone not full clear;<br>

But though they were of no richess,<br>

Yet were they made for great nobless,<br>

And in them greate sentence.*                              *significance<br>

And folk of digne* reverence,                             *worthy, lofty<br>

Of which *I will you telle fand,*               *I will try to tell you*<br>

Upon the pillars saw I stand.<br>

Altherfirst, lo! there I sigh*                                      *saw<br>

Upon a pillar stand on high,<br>

That was of lead and iron fine,<br>

Him of the secte Saturnine, &lt;61&gt;<br>

The Hebrew Josephus the old,<br>

That of Jewes' gestes* told;                            *deeds of braver<br>

And he bare on his shoulders high<br>

All the fame up of Jewry.<br>

And by him stooden other seven,<br>

Full wise and worthy for to neven,*                                *name<br>

To help him bearen up the charge,*                               *burden<br>

It was so heavy and so large.<br>

And, for they writen of battailes,<br>

As well as other old marvailes,<br>

Therefore was, lo! this pillere,<br>

Of which that I you telle here,<br>

Of lead and iron both, y-wis;<br>

For iron Marte's metal is, &lt;62&gt;<br>

Which that god is of battaile;<br>

And eke the lead, withoute fail,<br>

Is, lo! the metal of Saturn,<br>

That hath full large wheel* to turn.                              *orbit<br>

Then stoode forth, on either row,<br>

Of them which I coulde know,<br>

Though I them not by order tell,<br>

To make you too longe dwell.<br>

These, of the which I gin you read,<br>

There saw I standen, out of dread,<br>

Upon an iron pillar strong,<br>

That painted was all endelong*                      *from top to bottom*<br>

With tiger's blood in ev'ry place,<br>

The Tholosan that highte Stace, &lt;63&gt;<br>

That bare of Thebes up the name<br>

Upon his shoulders, and the fame<br>

Also of cruel Achilles.<br>

And by him stood, withoute lease,*                            *falsehood<br>

Full wondrous high on a pillere<br>

Of iron, he, the great Homere;<br>

And with him Dares and Dytus, &lt;64&gt;<br>

Before, and eke he, Lollius, &lt;65&gt;<br>

And Guido eke de Colempnis, &lt;66&gt;<br>

And English Gaufrid &lt;67&gt; eke, y-wis.<br>

And each of these, as I have joy,<br>

Was busy for to bear up Troy;<br>

So heavy thereof was the fame,<br>

That for to bear it was no game.<br>

But yet I gan full well espy,<br>

Betwixt them was a little envy.<br>

One said that Homer made lies,<br>

Feigning in his poetries,<br>

And was to the Greeks favourable;<br>

Therefore held he it but a fable.<br>

Then saw I stand on a pillere<br>

That was of tinned iron clear,<br>

Him, the Latin poet Virgile,<br>

That borne hath up a longe while<br>

The fame of pious Aeneas.<br>

And next him on a pillar was<br>

Of copper, Venus' clerk Ovide,<br>

That hath y-sowen wondrous wide<br>

The greate god of Love's fame.<br>

And there he bare up well his name<br>

Upon this pillar all so high,<br>

As I might see it with mine eye;<br>

For why? this hall whereof I read<br>

Was waxen in height, and length, and bread,*                    *breadth<br>

Well more by a thousand deal*                                     *times<br>

Than it was erst, that saw I weel.<br>

Then saw I on a pillar by,<br>

Of iron wrought full sternely,<br>

The greate poet, Dan Lucan,<br>

That on his shoulders bare up than,<br>

As high as that I might it see,<br>

The fame of Julius and Pompey; &lt;68&gt;<br>

And by him stood all those clerks<br>

That write of Rome's mighty works,<br>

That if I would their names tell,<br>

All too longe must I dwell.<br>

And next him on a pillar stood<br>

Of sulphur, like as he were wood,*                                  *mad<br>

Dan Claudian, &lt;69&gt; the sooth to tell,<br>

That bare up all the fame of hell,<br>

Of Pluto, and of Proserpine,<br>

That queen is of *the darke pine*               *the dark realm of pain*<br>

Why should I telle more of this?<br>

The hall was alle fulle, y-wis,<br>

Of them that writen olde gests,*               *histories of great deeds<br>

As be on trees rookes' nests;<br>

But it a full confus'd mattere<br>

Were all these gestes for to hear,<br>

That they of write, and how they hight.*                     *are called<br>
</p>

<p id="id02554"> But while that I beheld this sight,<br>

I heard a noise approache blive,*                               *quickly<br>

That far'd* as bees do in a hive,                                  *went<br>

Against their time of outflying;<br>

Right such a manner murmuring,<br>

For all the world, it seem'd to me.<br>

Then gan I look about, and see<br>

That there came entering the hall<br>

A right great company withal,<br>

And that of sundry regions,<br>

Of all kinds and conditions<br>

That dwell in earth under the moon,<br>

Both poor and rich; and all so soon<br>

As they were come into the hall,<br>

They gan adown on knees to fall,<br>

Before this ilke* noble queen,                                     *same<br>

And saide, "Grant us, Lady sheen,*                       *bright, lovely<br>

Each of us of thy grace a boon."*                                *favour<br>

And some of them she granted soon,<br>

And some she warned* well and fair,                             *refused<br>

And some she granted the contrair*                             *contrary<br>

Of their asking utterly;<br>

But this I say you truely,<br>

What that her cause was, I n'ist;*                   *wist not, know not<br>

For of these folk full well I wist,<br>

They hadde good fame each deserved,<br>

Although they were diversely served.<br>

Right as her sister, Dame Fortune,<br>

Is wont to serven *in commune.*                      *commonly, usually*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02555">Now hearken how she gan to pay<br>

Them that gan of her grace to pray;<br>

And right, lo! all this company<br>

Saide sooth,* and not a lie.                                      *truth<br>

"Madame," thus quoth they, "we be<br>

Folk that here beseeche thee<br>

That thou grant us now good fame,<br>

And let our workes have good name<br>

In full recompensatioun<br>

Of good work, give us good renown<br>

"I warn* it you," quoth she anon;                                *refuse<br>

"Ye get of me good fame none,<br>

By God! and therefore go your way."<br>

"Alas," quoth they, "and well-away!<br>

Tell us what may your cause be."<br>

"For that it list* me not," quoth she,                          *pleases<br>

<p id="id02556">And with that word she gan to call<br>

Her messenger, that was in hall,<br>

And bade that he should faste go'n,<br>

Upon pain to be blind anon,<br>

For Aeolus, the god of wind;<br>

"In Thrace there ye shall him find,<br>

And bid him bring his clarioun,<br>

That is full diverse of his soun',<br>

And it is called Cleare Laud,<br>

Them that me list, and do them shame."<br>

This messenger gan faste go'n,<br>

And found where, in a cave of stone,<br>

In a country that highte Thrace,<br>

This Aeolus, *with harde grace,*               *Evil favour attend him!*<br>

Helde the windes in distress,*                               *constraint<br>

And gan them under him to press,<br>

That they began as bears to roar,<br>

He bound and pressed them so sore.<br>

This messenger gan fast to cry,<br>

"Rise up," quoth he, "and fast thee hie,<br>

Until thou at my Lady be,<br>

And take thy clarions eke with thee,<br>

And speed thee forth." And he anon<br>

Took to him one that hight Triton, &lt;70&gt;<br>

His clarions to beare tho,*                                        *then<br>

And eke the man that Triton hete,*                            *is called<br>

<p id="id02557">And therewithal there came anon<br>

Another huge company<br>

Of goode folk, and gan to cry,<br>

"Lady, grant us goode fame,<br>

But what! it muste needes be.<br>

What did this Aeolus, but he<br>

Took out his blacke trump of brass,<br>

That fouler than the Devil was,<br>

And gan this trumpet for to blow,<br>

As all the world 't would overthrow.<br>

Throughout every regioun<br>

Went this foule trumpet's soun',<br>

As swift as pellet out of gun<br>

When fire is in the powder run.<br>

And such a smoke gan out wend,*                                      *go<br>

Alas! thus was their shame y-rung,<br>

And out his trump of gold he braid*                        *pulled forth<br>

Since that first I hadde wit,<br>

That some folk have desired fame<br>

Diversely, and los, and name;<br>

Nor eke of her description,<br>

Nor also her condition,<br>

Nor *the order of her doom,*            *the principle of her judgments*<br>

"Why, then, lo! be these tidings,<br>

That thou nowe hither brings,<br>

That thou hast heard?" quoth he to me.<br>

"But now *no force,* for well I see                          *no matter*<br>

And lo! this house of which I write,<br>

*Sicker be ye,* it was not lite;*                    *be assured* *small<br>

For it was sixty mile of length,<br>

All* was the timber of no strength;                            *although<br>

Yet it is founded to endure,<br>

*While that it list to Adventure,*               *while fortune pleases*<br>

That is the mother of tidings,<br>

As is the sea of wells and springs;<br>

And it was shapen like a cage.<br>

"Certes," quoth I, "in all mine age,*                              *life<br>

Ne'er saw I such a house as this."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02567">And as I wonder'd me, y-wis,<br>

Upon this house, then ware was I<br>

How that mine eagle, faste by,<br>

Was perched high upon a stone;<br>

And I gan straighte to him go'n,<br>

And saide thus; "I praye thee<br>

"Peter! that is mine intent,"<br>

Quoth he to me; "therefore I dwell;*                              *tarry<br>

But, certain, one thing I thee tell,<br>

"No," quoth he; "telle me what."<br>

And then he told him this and that,<br>

And swore thereto, that it was sooth;<br>

"Thus hath he said," and "Thus he do'th,"<br>

And "Thus shall 't be," and "Thus heard I say<br>

"That shall be found, that dare I lay;"*                          *wager<br>

What aloud, and what in th'ear.<br>

But all the wonder most was this;<br>

When one had heard a thing, y-wis,<br>

He came straight to another wight,<br>

And gan him tellen anon right<br>

The same tale that to him was told,<br>

Or it a furlong way was old, &lt;84&gt;<br>

And gan somewhat for to eche*                                  *eke, add<br>

To this tiding in his speech,<br>

More than it ever spoken was.<br>

And not so soon departed n'as*                                      *was<br>

He from him, than that he met<br>

With the third; and *ere he let<br>

Any stound,* he told him als';                *without delaying a momen*<br>

Were the tidings true or false,<br>

Yet would he tell it natheless,<br>

And evermore with more increase<br>

Than it was erst.* Thus north and south                        *at first<br>

Went ev'ry tiding from mouth to mouth,<br>

And that increasing evermo',<br>

As fire is wont to *quick and go*             *become alive, and spread*<br>

From a spark y-sprung amiss,<br>

Till all a city burnt up is.<br>

And when that it was full up-sprung,<br>

And waxen* more on ev'ry tongue                               *increased<br>

Than e'er it was, it went anon<br>

Up to a window out to go'n;<br>

Or, but it mighte thereout pass,<br>

It gan creep out at some crevass,*                       *crevice, chink<br>

And fly forth faste for the nonce.<br>

And sometimes saw I there at once<br>

*A leasing, and a sad sooth saw,*            *a falsehood and an earnest<br>

That gan *of adventure* draw                     true saying* *by chance<br>

Out at a window for to pace;<br>

And when they metten in that place,<br>

They were checked both the two,<br>

And neither of them might out go;<br>

For other so they gan *to crowd,*            *push, squeeze, each other*<br>

Till each of them gan cryen loud,<br>

"Let me go first!" — "Nay, but let me!<br>

And here I will ensure thee,<br>

With vowes, if thou wilt do so,<br>

That I shall never from thee go,<br>

But be thine owen sworen brother!<br>

We will us medle* each with other,                               *mingle<br>

Be we cried or *still y-rowned."*                    *quietly whispered*<br>

Thus saw I false and sooth, compouned,*                      *compounded<br>

Together fly for one tiding.<br>

Then out at holes gan to wring*                       *squeeze, struggle<br>

Every tiding straight to Fame;<br>

And she gan give to each his name<br>

After her disposition,<br>

And gave them eke duration,<br>

Some to wax and wane soon,<br>

As doth the faire white moon;<br>

And let them go. There might I see<br>

Winged wonders full fast flee,<br>

Twenty thousand in a rout,*                                     *company<br>

As Aeolus them blew about.<br>

And, Lord! this House in alle times<br>

Was full of shipmen and pilgrimes, &lt;85&gt;<br>

With *scrippes bretfull of leasings,*    *wallets brimful of falsehoods*<br>

Entremedled with tidings*                                  *true stories<br>

And eke alone by themselve.<br>

And many thousand times twelve<br>

Saw I eke of these pardoners,&lt;86&gt;<br>

Couriers, and eke messengers,<br>

With boistes* crammed full of lies                                *boxes<br>

As ever vessel was with lyes.*                             *lees of wine<br>

And as I altherfaste* went                               *with all speed<br>

About, and did all mine intent<br>

Me *for to play and for to lear,*         *to amuse and instruct myself*<br>

And eke a tiding for to hear<br>

That I had heard of some country,<br>

That shall not now be told for me; —<br>

For it no need is, readily;<br>

Folk can sing it better than I.<br>

For all must out, or late or rath,*                                *soon<br>

All the sheaves in the lath;*                                 *barn &lt;87&gt;<br>

I heard a greate noise withal<br>

In a corner of the hall,<br>

Where men of love tidings told;<br>

And I gan thitherward behold,<br>

For I saw running ev'ry wight<br>

As fast as that they hadde might,<br>

And ev'reach cried, "What thing is that?"<br>

And some said, "I know never what."<br>

And when they were all on a heap,<br>

Those behinde gan up leap,<br>

And clomb* upon each other fast, &lt;88&gt;                           *climbed<br>

And up the noise on high they cast,<br>

And trodden fast on others' heels,<br>

And stamp'd, as men do after eels.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02569">But at the last I saw a man,<br>

Which that I not describe can;<br>

But that he seemed for to be<br>

A man of great authority.<br>

And therewith I anon abraid*                                      *awoke<br>

Out of my sleepe, half afraid;<br>

Rememb'ring well what I had seen,<br>

And how high and far I had been<br>

In my ghost; and had great wonder<br>

Of what the mighty god of thunder<br>

Had let me know; and gan to write<br>

Like as ye have me heard endite.<br>

Wherefore to study and read alway<br>

I purpose to do day by day.<br>

And thus, in dreaming and in game,<br>

Endeth this little book of Fame.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02570">Here endeth the Book of Fame</p>

<p id="id02571" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to The House of Fame</p>

<p id="id02572" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Rood: the cross on which Christ was crucified; Anglo-Saxon,
"Rode."</p>

<p id="id02573">2. Well worth of this thing greate clerks: Great scholars set
much worth upon this thing —  that is, devote much labour,
attach much importance, to the subject of dreams.</p>

<p id="id02574">3. The poet briefly refers to the description of the House of
Somnus, in Ovid's "Metamorphoses," 1. xi. 592, et seqq.; where
the cave of Somnus is said to be "prope Cimmerios," ("near the
Cimmerians") and "Saxo tamen exit ab imo Rivus aquae
Lethes." ("A stream of Lethe's water issues from the base of the
rock")</p>

<p id="id02575">4. See the account of the vision of Croesus in The Monk's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02576">5. The meaning of the allusion is not clear; but the story of the
pilgrims and the peas is perhaps suggested by the line following
— "to make lithe [soft] what erst was hard." St Leonard was the
patron of captives.</p>

<p id="id02577">5. Corsaint:  The "corpus sanctum" — the holy body, or relics,
preserved in the shrine.</p>

<p id="id02578">7. So, in the Temple of Venus described in The Knight's Tale,
the Goddess is represented as "naked floating in the large sea".</p>

<p id="id02579">8. Vulcano: Vulcan, the husband of Venus.</p>

<p id="id02580">9. Ered: ploughed; Latin, "arare," Anglo-Saxon, "erean,"
plough.</p>

<p id="id02581">10. Sours: Soaring ascent; a hawk was said to be "on the soar"
when he mounted, "on the sours" or "souse" when he
descended on the prey, and took it in flight.</p>

<p id="id02582">11. This is only one among many instances in which Chaucer
disclaims the pursuits of love; and the description of his manner
of life which follows is sufficient to show that the disclaimer
was no mere mock-humble affectation of a gallant.</p>

<p id="id02583">12. This reference, approximately fixing the date at which the
poem was composed, points clearly to Chaucer's daily work as
Comptroller of the Customs — a post which he held from 1374
to 1386.</p>

<p id="id02584">13. This is a frank enough admission that the poet was fond of
good cheer; and the effect of his "little abstinence" on his
corporeal appearance is humorously described in the Prologue
to the Tale of Sir Thopas, where the Host compliments Chaucer
on being as well shapen in the waist as himself.</p>

<p id="id02585">14. "To make the beard" means to befool or deceive. See note
15 to the Reeve's Tale. Precisely the same idea is conveyed in
the modern slang word "shave" — meaning a trick or fraud.</p>

<p id="id02586">15. Love-days: see note 21 to the Prologue to the Canterbury
Tales.</p>

<p id="id02587">16. If this reference is to any book of Chaucer's in which the
House of Fame was mentioned, the book has not come down to
us. It has been reasonably supposed, however, that Chaucer
means by "his own book" Ovid's "Metamorphoses," of which he
was evidently very fond; and in the twelfth book of that poem
the Temple of Fame is described.</p>

<p id="id02588">17. Saint Julian was the patron of hospitality; so the Franklin, in
the Prologue to The Canterbury Tales is said to be "Saint Julian
in his country," for his open house and liberal cheer. The eagle,
at sight of the House of Fame, cries out "bon hostel!" — "a fair
lodging, a glorious house, by St Julian!"</p>

<p id="id02589">18. The laurel-tree is sacred to Apollo.  See note 11 to The
Assembly of Fowls.</p>

<p id="id02590">19. French, "roche," a rock.</p>

<p id="id02591">20. St. Thomas of Kent:  Thomas a Beckett, whose shrine was
at Canterbury.</p>

<p id="id02592">21. The half or side of the rock which was towards the poet,
was inscribed with, etc.</p>

<p id="id02593">22. Cop: summit; German, "kopf"; the head.</p>

<p id="id02594">23. Gestiours:  tellers of stories; reciters of brave feats or
"gests."</p>

<p id="id02595">24. Arion: the celebrated Greek bard and citharist, who, in the
seventh century before Christ, lived at the court of Periander,
tyrant of Corinth. The story of his preservation by the dolphin,
when the covetous sailors forced him to leap into the sea, is
well known.</p>

<p id="id02596">25. Chiron the Centaur was renowned for skill in music and the
arts, which he owed to the teaching of Apollo and Artemis. He
became in turn the instructor of Peleus, Achilles, and other
descendants of Aeacus; hence he is called "Aeacides" — because
tutor to the Aeacides, and thus, so to speak, of that "family."</p>

<p id="id02597">26. Glasgerion is the subject of a ballad given in "Percy's<br>

Reliques," where we are told that<br>

"Glasgerion was a king's own son,<br>

 And a harper he was good;<br>

 He harped in the king's chamber,<br>

 Where cup and candle stood."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02598">27. Cornemuse: bagpipe; French, "cornemuse." Shawmies:
shalms or psalteries; an instrument resembling a harp.</p>

<p id="id02599">28. Dulcet: a kind of pipe, probably corresponding with the
"dulcimer;" the idea of sweet — French, "doux;" Latin, "dulcis"
— is at the root of both words.</p>

<p id="id02600">29. In the early printed editions of Chaucer, the two names are
"Citherus" and "Proserus;" in the manuscript which Mr Bell
followed (No. 16 in the Fairfax collection) they are "Atileris"
and "Pseustis." But neither alternative gives more than the
slightest clue to identification. "Citherus" has been retained in
the text; it may have been employed as an appellative of Apollo,
derived from "cithara," the instrument on which he played; and
it is not easy to suggest a better substitute for it than "Clonas" -
- an early Greek poet and musician who flourished six hundred
years before Christ. For "Proserus," however, has been
substituted "Pronomus," the name of a celebrated Grecian
player on the pipe, who taught Alcibiades the flute, and who
therefore, although Theban by birth, might naturally be said by
the poet to be "of Athens."</p>

<p id="id02601">30. Marsyas: The Phrygian, who, having found the flute of
Athena, which played of itself most exquisite music, challenged
Apollo to a contest, the victor in which was to do with the
vanquished as he pleased. Marsyas was beaten, and Apollo
flayed him alive.</p>

<p id="id02602">31. The German (Deutsche) language, in Chaucer's time, had
not undergone that marked literary division into German and
Dutch which was largely accomplished through the influence of
the works of Luther and the other Reformers. Even now, the
flute is the favourite musical instrument of the Fatherland; and
the devotion of the Germans to poetry and music has been
celebrated since the days of Tacitus.</p>

<p id="id02603">32. Reyes: a kind of dance, or song to be accompanied with
dancing.</p>

<p id="id02604">33. Beam: horn, trumpet; Anglo-Saxon, "bema."</p>

<p id="id02605">34. Messenus: Misenus, son of Aeolus, the companion and
trumpeter of Aeneas, was drowned near the Campanian
headland called Misenum after his name. (Aeneid, vi. 162 et
seqq.)</p>

<p id="id02606">35. Joab's fame as a trumpeter is founded on two verses in 2
Samuel (ii. 28, xx. 22), where we are told that he "blew a
trumpet," which all the people of Israel obeyed, in the one case
desisting from a pursuit, in the other raising a siege.</p>

<p id="id02607">36. Theodamas or Thiodamas, king of the Dryopes, plays a
prominent part in the tenth book of Statius' "Thebaid." Both he
and Joab are also mentioned as great trumpeters in The
Merchant's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02608">37. Jongelours: jugglers; French, "jongleur."</p>

<p id="id02609">38. Tregetours: tricksters, jugglers. For explanation of this
word, see note 14 to the Franklin's tale.</p>

<p id="id02610">39. Pythonesses:  women who, like the Pythia in Apollo's
temple at Delphi, were possessed with a spirit of divination or
prophecy. The barbarous Latin form of the word was
"Pythonissa" or "Phitonissa." See note 9 to the Friar's Tale.</p>

<p id="id02611">40. Subfumigations:  a ceremony employed to drive away evil
spirits by burning incense; the practice of smoking cattle, corn,
&amp;c., has not died out in some country districts.</p>

<p id="id02612">41. In certain ascendents: under certain planetary influences.
The next lines recall the alleged malpractices of witches, who
tortured little images of wax, in the design of causing the same
torments to the person represented — or, vice versa, treated
these images for the cure of hurts or sickness.</p>

<p id="id02613">42. Medea: celebrated for her magical power, through which
she restored to youth Aeson, the father of Jason; and caused the
death of Jason's wife, Creusa, by sending her a poisoned
garment which consumed her to ashes.</p>

<p id="id02614">43. Circes: the sorceress Circe, who changed the companions of
Ulysses into swine.</p>

<p id="id02615">44. Calypsa: Calypso, on whose island of Ogygia Ulysses was
wrecked. The goddess promised the hero immortality if he
remained with her; but he refused, and, after a detention of
seven years, she had to let him go.</p>

<p id="id02616">45. Hermes Ballenus: this is supposed to mean Hermes
Trismegistus (of whom see note 19 to the Canon's Yeoman's
Tale); but the explanation of the word "Ballenus" is not quite
obvious. The god Hermes of the Greeks (Mercurius of the
Romans) had the surname "Cyllenius," from the mountain
where he was born — Mount Cyllene, in Arcadia; and the
alteration into "Ballenus" would be quite within the range of a
copyist's capabilities, while we find in the mythological
character of Hermes enough to warrant his being classed with
jugglers and magicians.</p>

<p id="id02617">46. Limote and Colle Tregetour seem to have been famous
sorcerers or jugglers, but nothing is now known of either.</p>

<p id="id02618">47. Simon Magus: of whom we read in Acts viii. 9, et seqq.</p>

<p id="id02619">48. "And made well more than it was<br>

     To seemen ev'rything, y-wis,<br>

     As kindly thing of Fame it is;"<br>

i.e. It is in the nature of fame to exaggerate everything.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02620">49. Corbets: the corbels, or capitals of pillars in a Gothic
building; they were often carved with fantastic figures and
devices.</p>

<p id="id02621">50. A largess!: the cry with which heralds and pursuivants at a

<h3 id="id02660" style="margin-top: 3em">TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.</h3>

<p id="id02661" style="margin-top: 2em">[In several respects, the story of "Troilus and Cressida" may be
regarded as Chaucer's noblest poem. Larger in scale than any
other of his individual works — numbering nearly half as many
lines as The Canterbury Tales contain, without reckoning the
two in prose — the conception of the poem is yet so closely and
harmoniously worked out, that all the parts are perfectly
balanced, and from first to last scarcely a single line is
superfluous or misplaced. The finish and beauty of the poem as
a work of art, are not more conspicuous than the knowledge of
human nature displayed in the portraits of the principal
characters. The result is, that the poem is more modern, in form
and in spirit, than almost any other work of its author; the
chaste style and sedulous polish of the stanzas admit of easy
change into the forms of speech now current in England; while
the analytical and subjective character of the work gives it, for
the nineteenth century reader, an interest of the same kind as
that inspired, say, by George Eliot's wonderful study of
character in "Romola." Then, above all, "Troilus and Cressida"
is distinguished by a purity and elevation of moral tone, that
may surprise those who judge of Chaucer only by the coarse
traits of his time preserved in The Canterbury Tales, or who
may expect to find here the Troilus, the Cressida, and the
Pandarus of Shakspeare's play. It is to no trivial gallant, no
woman of coarse mind and easy virtue, no malignantly
subservient and utterly debased procurer, that Chaucer
introduces us. His Troilus is a noble, sensitive, generous, pure-
souled, manly, magnanimous hero, who is only confirmed and
stimulated in all virtue by his love, who lives for his lady, and
dies for her falsehood, in a lofty and chivalrous fashion. His
Cressida is a stately, self-contained, virtuous, tender-hearted
woman, who loves with all the pure strength and trustful
abandonment of a generous and exalted nature, and who is
driven to infidelity perhaps even less by pressure of
circumstances, than by the sheer force of her love, which will go
on loving — loving what it can have, when that which it would
rather have is for the time unattainable. His Pandarus is a
gentleman, though a gentleman with a flaw in him; a man who,
in his courtier-like good-nature, places the claims of
comradeship above those of honour, and plots away the virtue
of his niece, that he may appease the love-sorrow of his friend;
all the time conscious that he is not acting as a gentleman
should, and desirous that others should give him that
justification which he can get but feebly and diffidently in
himself. In fact, the "Troilus and Cressida" of Chaucer is the
"Troilus and Cressida" of Shakespeare transfigured; the
atmosphere, the colour, the spirit, are wholly different; the older
poet presents us in the chief characters to noble natures, the
younger to ignoble natures in all the characters; and the poem
with which we have now to do stands at this day among the
noblest expositions of love's workings in the human heart and
life. It is divided into five books, containing altogether 8246
lines. The First Book (1092 lines) tells how Calchas, priest of
Apollo, quitting beleaguered Troy, left there his only daughter
Cressida; how Troilus, the youngest brother of Hector and son
of King Priam, fell in love with her at first sight, at a festival in
the temple of Pallas, and sorrowed bitterly for her love; and
how his friend, Cressida's uncle, Pandarus, comforted him by
the promise of aid in his suit. The Second Book (1757 lines)
relates the subtle manoeuvres of Pandarus to induce Cressida to
return the love of Troilus; which he accomplishes mainly by
touching at once the lady's admiration for his heroism, and her
pity for his love-sorrow on her account. The Third Book (1827
lines) opens with an account of the first interview between the
lovers; ere it closes, the skilful stratagems of Pandarus have
placed the pair in each other's arms under his roof, and the
lovers are happy in perfect enjoyment of each other's love and
trust. In the Fourth Book (1701 lines) the course of true love
ceases to run smooth; Cressida is compelled to quit the city, in
ransom for Antenor, captured in a skirmish; and she sadly
departs to the camp of the Greeks, vowing that she will make
her escape, and return to Troy and Troilus within ten days. The
Fifth Book (1869 lines) sets out by describing the court which
Diomedes, appointed to escort her, pays to Cressida on the way
to the camp; it traces her gradual progress from indifference to
her new suitor, to incontinence with him, and it leaves the
deserted Troilus dead on the field of battle, where he has sought
an eternal refuge from the new grief provoked by clear proof of
his mistress's infidelity. The polish, elegance, and power of the
style, and the acuteness of insight into character, which mark
the poem, seem to claim for it a date considerably later than that
adopted by those who assign its composition to Chaucer's
youth: and the literary allusions and proverbial expressions with
which it abounds, give ample evidence that, if Chaucer really
wrote it at an early age, his youth must have been precocious
beyond all actual record. Throughout the poem there are
repeated references to the old authors of Trojan histories who
are named in "The House of Fame"; but Chaucer especially
mentions one Lollius as the author from whom he takes the
groundwork of the poem. Lydgate is responsible for the
assertion that Lollius meant Boccaccio; and though there is no
authority for supposing that the English really meant to
designate the Italian poet under that name, there is abundant
internal proof that the poem was really founded on the
"Filostrato" of Boccaccio. But the tone of Chaucer's work is
much higher than that of his Italian "auctour;" and while in
some passages the imitation is very close, in all that is
characteristic in "Troilus and Cressida," Chaucer has fairly
thrust his models out of sight. In the present edition, it has been
possible to give no more than about one-fourth of the poem —
274 out of the 1178 seven-line stanzas that compose it; but
pains have been taken to convey, in the connecting prose
passages, a faithful idea of what is perforce omitted.]</p>

Of Troilus, in loving of Cresside,<br>

And how that she forsook him ere she died.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02671">In Troy, during the siege, dwelt "a lord of great authority, a
great divine," named Calchas; who, through the oracle of
Apollo, knew that Troy should be destroyed. He stole away
secretly to the Greek camp, where he was gladly received, and
honoured for his skill in divining, of which the besiegers hoped
to make use. Within the city there was great anger at the
treason of Calchas; and the people declared that he and all his
kin were worthy to be burnt. His daughter, whom he had left in
the city, a widow and alone, was in great fear for her life.</p>

<p id="id02672">Cressida was this lady's name aright;<br>

*As to my doom,* in alle Troy city                      *in my judgment*<br>

So fair was none, for over ev'ry wight<br>

So angelic was her native beauty,<br>

That like a thing immortal seemed she,<br>

As sooth a perfect heav'nly creature,<br>

That down seem'd sent in scorning of Nature.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02673">In her distress, "well nigh out of her wit for pure fear," she
appealed for protection to Hector; who, "piteous of nature,"
and touched by her sorrow and her beauty, assured her of
safety, so long as she pleased to dwell in Troy. The siege went
on; but they of Troy did not neglect the honour and worship of
their deities; most of all of "the relic hight Palladion, &lt;4&gt; that
was their trust aboven ev'ry one." In April, "when clothed is the
mead with newe green, of jolly Ver [Spring] the prime," the
Trojans went to hold the festival of Palladion —  crowding to
the temple, "in all their beste guise," lusty knights, fresh ladies,
and maidens bright.</p>

<p id="id02674">Among the which was this Cresseida,<br>

In widow's habit black; but natheless,<br>

Right as our firste letter is now A,<br>

Her goodly looking gladded all the press;*                        *crowd<br>

And yet she stood, full low and still, alone,<br>

Behind all other folk, *in little brede,*              *inconspicuously*<br>

And nigh the door, ay *under shame's drede;*        *for dread of shame*<br>

<p id="id02676">Dan Troilus, as he was wont to guide<br>

Now here, now there, for no devotioun<br>

Had he to none, to *reave him* his rest,                *deprive him of*<br>

But gan to *praise and lacke whom him lest;*       *praise and disparage<br>

On any woman that he could espy;<br>

Then he would smile, and hold it a folly,<br>

And say him thus: "Ah, Lord, she sleepeth soft<br>

For love of thee, when as thou turnest oft.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02677">"I have heard told, pardie, of your living,<br>

<p id="id02678">But the God of Love vowed vengeance on Troilus for that

<p id="id02685">She thus, in black, looking to Troilus,<br>

Over all things he stoode to behold;<br>

But his desire, nor wherefore he stood thus,<br>

He neither *cheere made,* nor worde told;    *showed by his countenance*<br>

But from afar, *his manner for to hold,*       *to observe due courtesy*<br>

Of scorn fell on himself; but what he meant,<br>

Lest it were wist on any manner side,<br>

His woe he gan dissemble and eke hide.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02687">Returning to his palace, he begins hypocritically to smile and
jest at Love's servants and their pains; but by and by he has to
dismiss his attendants, feigning "other busy needs." Then, alone
in his chamber, he begins to groan and sigh, and call up again
Cressida's form as he saw her in the temple — "making a mirror
of his mind, in which he saw all wholly her figure." He thinks no
travail or sorrow too high a price for the love of such a goodly
woman; and, "full unadvised of his woe coming,"</p>

<p id="id02688">Thus took he purpose Love's craft to sue,*                       *follow<br>

And thought that he would work all privily,<br>

First for to hide his desire all *in mew*           *in a cage, secretly<br>

*But he might aught recover'd be thereby;*      *unless he gained by it*<br>

Rememb'ring him, that love *too wide y-blow*        *too much spoken of*<br>

Yields bitter fruit, although sweet seed be sow.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02689">And, over all this, muche more he thought<br>

And on a song anon right to begin,<br>

For with good hope he gan thus to assent*                       *resolve<br>

Cressida for to love, and not repent.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02690">The Song of Troilus. &lt;9&gt;</p>

<p id="id02691">"If no love is, O God! why feel I so?<br>

And if love is, what thing and which is he?<br>

If love be good, from whence cometh my woe?<br>

Whence ev'ry torment and adversity<br>

That comes of love *may to me savoury think:*    *seem acceptable to me*<br>

</p>

<p id="id02692">"And if I *at mine owen luste bren*                *burn by my own will*<br>

That in contrary standen evermo'.<br>

Alas! what wonder is this malady! —<br>

For heat of cold, for cold of heat, I die!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02694">Devoting himself wholly to the thought of Cressida — though he
yet knew not whether she was woman or goddess — Troilus, in
spite of his royal blood, became the very slave of love. He set at
naught every other charge, but to gaze on her as often as he
could; thinking so to appease his hot fire, which thereby only
burned the hotter. He wrought marvellous feats of arms against
the Greeks, that she might like him the better for his renown;
then love deprived him of sleep, and made his food his foe; till
he had to "borrow a title of other sickness," that men might not
know he was consumed with love. Meantime, Cressida gave no
sign that she heeded his devotion, or even knew of it; and he
was now consumed with a new fear — lest she loved some other
man. Bewailing his sad lot — ensnared, exposed to the scorn of
those whose love he had ridiculed, wishing himself arrived at
the port of death, and praying ever that his lady might glad him
with some kind look — Troilus is surprised in his chamber by his
friend Pandarus, the uncle of Cressida. Pandarus, seeking to
divert his sorrow by making him angry, jeeringly asks whether
remorse of conscience, or devotion, or fear of the Greeks, has
caused all this ado. Troilus pitifully beseeches his friend to leave
him to die alone, for die he must, from a cause which he must
keep hidden; but Pandarus argues against Troilus' cruelty in
hiding from a friend such a sorrow, and Troilus at last confesses
that his malady is love. Pandarus suggests that the beloved
object may be such that his counsel might advance his friend's
desires; but Troilus scouts the suggestion, saying that Pandarus
could never govern himself in love.</p>

<p id="id02695">"Yea, Troilus, hearken to me," quoth Pandare,<br>

"Though I be nice;* it happens often so,                        *foolish<br>

That one that access* doth full evil fare,        *in an access of fever<br>

By good counsel can keep his friend therefro'.<br>

I have my selfe seen a blind man go<br>

Where as he fell that looke could full wide;<br>

A fool may eke a wise man often guide.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02696">"A whetstone is no carving instrument,<br>

But yet it maketh sharpe carving tooles;<br>

And, if thou know'st that I have aught miswent,*          *erred, failed<br>

Eschew thou that, for such thing to thee school* is.  *schooling, lesson<br>

Thus oughte wise men to beware by fooles;<br>

If so thou do, thy wit is well bewared;<br>

By its contrary is everything declared.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02697">"For how might ever sweetness have been know
To him that never tasted bitterness?
And no man knows what gladness is, I trow,
That never was in sorrow or distress:
Eke white by black, by shame eke worthiness,
Each set by other, *more for other seemeth,*        *its quality is made
As men may see; and so the wise man deemeth."            more obvious by
                                                           the contrast*
Troilus, however, still begs his friend to leave him to mourn in
peace, for all his proverbs can avail nothing. But Pandarus
insists on plying the lover with wise saws, arguments,
reproaches; hints that, if he should die of love, his lady may
impute his death to fear of the Greeks; and finally induces
Troilus to admit that the well of all his woe, his sweetest foe, is
called Cressida. Pandarus breaks into praises of the lady, and
congratulations of his friend for so well fixing his heart; he
makes Troilus utter a formal confession of his sin in jesting at
lovers and bids him think well that she of whom rises all his
woe, hereafter may his comfort be also.</p>

<p id="id02698">"For thilke* ground, that bears the weedes wick'              *that same<br>

Bears eke the wholesome herbes, and full oft<br>

And next the valley is the hill aloft,<br>

And next the darke night is the glad morrow,<br>

And also joy is next the fine* of sorrow."                  *end, border<br>
</p>

<p id="id02699">Pandarus holds out to Troilus good hope of achieving his
desire; and tells him that, since he has been converted from his
wicked rebellion against Love, he shall be made the best post of
all Love's law, and most grieve Love's enemies. Troilus gives
utterance to a hint of fear; but he is silenced by Pandarus with
another proverb —  "Thou hast full great care, lest that the carl
should fall out of the moon." Then the lovesick youth breaks
into a joyous boast that some of the Greeks shall smart; he
mounts his horse, and plays the lion in the field; while Pandarus
retires to consider how he may best recommend to his niece the
suit of Troilus.</p>

<h4 id="id02700" style="margin-top: 2em">THE SECOND BOOK.</h4>

<p id="id02701" style="margin-top: 2em">IN the Proem to the Second Book, the poet hails the clear
weather that enables him to sail out of those black waves in
which his boat so laboured that he could scarcely steer — that is,
"the tempestuous matter of despair, that Troilus was in; but
now of hope the kalendes begin." He invokes the aid of Clio;
excuses himself to every lover for what may be found amiss in a
book which he only translates; and, obviating any lover's
objection to the way in which Troilus obtained his lady's grace -
- through Pandarus' mediation — says it seems to him no
wonderful thing:</p>

<p id="id02702">"For ev'ry wighte that to Rome went<br>

Held not one path, nor alway one mannere;<br>

Eke in some lands were all the game y-shent<br>

If that men far'd in love as men do here,<br>

As thus, in open dealing and in cheer,<br>

In visiting, in form, or saying their saws;*                   *speeches<br>

For thus men say: Each country hath its laws.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02703">"Eke scarcely be there in this place three<br>

That have in love done or said *like in all;"*   *alike in all respects*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02704">And so that which the poem relates may not please the reader —
but it actually was done, or it shall yet be done. The Book sets
out with the visit of Pandarus to Cressida:—</p>

<p id="id02705">In May, that mother is of monthes glade,*                          *glad<br>

When all the freshe flowers, green and red,<br>

Be quick* again, that winter deade made,                          *alive<br>

And full of balm is floating ev'ry mead;<br>

When Phoebus doth his brighte beames spread<br>

Right in the white Bull, so it betid*                          *happened<br>

As I shall sing, on Maye's day the thrid, &lt;11&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02706">That Pandarus, for all his wise speech,<br>

Felt eke his part of Love's shottes keen,<br>

That, could he ne'er so well of Love preach,<br>

It made yet his hue all day full green;*                           *pale<br>

So *shope it,* that him fell that day a teen*      *it happened* *access<br>

In love, for which full woe to bed he went,<br>

And made ere it were day full many a went.*                *turning &lt;12&gt;<br>
</p>

When morrow came, gan make her waimenting,*                   *lamenting<br>

Why she foshapen* was; and ever lay                         *transformed<br>

Pandare a-bed, half in a slumbering,<br>

Till she so nigh him made her chittering,<br>

How Tereus gan forth her sister take,<br>

That with the noise of her he did awake,<br>
</p>

<p id="id02708">And gan to call, and dress* him to arise,                       *prepare<br>

Rememb'ring him his errand was to do'n<br>

From Troilus, and eke his great emprise;<br>

And cast, and knew in *good plight* was the Moon     *favourable aspect*<br>

To do voyage, and took his way full soon<br>

Unto his niece's palace there beside<br>

Now Janus, god of entry, thou him guide!<br>
</p>

<p id="id02709">Pandarus finds his niece, with two other ladies, in a paved
parlour, listening to a maiden who reads aloud the story of the
Siege of Thebes. Greeting the company, he is welcomed by
Cressida, who tells him that for three nights she has dreamed of
him. After some lively talk about the book they had been
reading, Pandarus asks his niece to do away her hood, to show
her face bare, to lay aside the book, to rise up and dance, "and
let us do to May some observance." Cressida cries out, "God
forbid!" and asks if he is mad — if that is a widow's life, whom it
better becomes to sit in a cave and read of holy saints' lives.
Pandarus intimates that he could tell her something which could
make her merry; but he refuses to gratify her curiosity; and, by
way of the siege and of Hector, "that was the towne's wall, and
Greekes' yerd" or scourging-rod, the conversation is brought
round to Troilus, whom Pandarus highly extols as "the wise
worthy Hector the second." She has, she says, already heard
Troilus praised for his bravery "of them that her were liefest
praised be" [by whom it would be most welcome to her to be
praised].</p>

<p id="id02710">"Ye say right sooth, y-wis," quoth Pandarus;<br>

For yesterday, who so had with him been,<br>

Might have wonder'd upon Troilus;<br>

For never yet so thick a swarm of been*                            *bees<br>

Ne flew, as did of Greekes from him flee'n;<br>

And through the field, in ev'ry wighte's ear,<br>

There was no cry but 'Troilus is here.'<br>
</p>

<p id="id02711">"Now here, now there, he hunted them so fast,<br>

There was but Greekes' blood; and Troilus<br>

Now him he hurt, now him adown he cast;<br>

Ay where he went it was arrayed thus:<br>

He was their death, and shield of life for us,<br>

That as that day there durst him none withstand,<br>

While that he held his bloody sword in hand."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02712">Pandarus makes now a show of taking leave, but Cressida
detains him, to speak of her affairs; then, the business talked
over, he would again go, but first again asks his niece to arise
and dance, and cast her widow's garments to mischance,
because of the glad fortune that has befallen her. More curious
than ever, she seeks to find out Pandarus' secret; but he still
parries her curiosity, skilfully hinting all the time at her good
fortune, and the wisdom of seizing on it when offered. In the
end he tells her that the noble Troilus so loves her, that with her
it lies to make him live or die — but if Troilus dies, Pandarus
shall die with him; and then she will have "fished fair." &lt;14&gt; He
beseeches mercy for his friend:</p>

<p id="id02713">"*Woe worth* the faire gemme virtueless! &lt;15&gt;             *evil befall!*<br>

Woe worth the herb also that *doth no boot!*     *has no remedial power*<br>

Woe worth the beauty that is rutheless!*                      *merciless<br>

Woe worth that wight that treads each under foot!<br>

And ye that be of beauty *crop and root*                *perfection &lt;16&gt;<br>

If therewithal in you there be no ruth,*                           *pity<br>

Then is it harm ye live, by my truth!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02714">Pandarus makes only the slight request that she will show
Troilus somewhat better cheer, and receive visits from him, that
his life may be saved; urging that, although a man be soon going
to the temple, nobody will think that he eats the images; and
that "such love of friends reigneth in all this town."</p>

<p id="id02715">Cressida, which that heard him in this wise,<br>

Thought: "I shall feele* what he means, y-wis;"                    *test<br>

"Now, eme* quoth she, "what would ye me devise?                   *uncle<br>

What is your rede* that I should do of this?"          *counsel, opinion<br>

"That is well said," quoth he;" certain best it is<br>

That ye him love again for his loving,<br>

As love for love is *skilful guerdoning.*        *reasonable recompense*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02716">"Think eke how elde* wasteth ev'ry hour                             *age<br>

In each of you a part of your beauty;<br>

And therefore, ere that age do you devour,<br>

Go love, for, old, there will no wight love thee<br>

Let this proverb a lore* unto you be:                            *lesson<br>

'"Too late I was ware," quoth beauty when it past;<br>

And *elde daunteth danger* at the last.'     *old age overcomes disdain*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02717">"The kinge's fool is wont to cry aloud,
When that he thinks a woman bears her high,
'So longe may ye liven, and all proud,
Till crowes' feet be wox* under your eye!                         *grown
And send you then a mirror *in to pry*                      *to look in*
In which ye may your face see a-morrow!*                 *in the morning

Weeping, Cressida reproaches her uncle for giving her such
counsel; whereupon Pandarus, starting up, threatens to kill
himself, and would fain depart, but that his niece detains him,
and, with much reluctance, promises to "make Troilus good
cheer in honour." Invited by Cressida to tell how first he know
her lover's woe, Pandarus then relates two soliloquies which he
had accidentally overheard, and in which Troilus had poured
out all the sorrow of his passion.</p>

<p id="id02718">With this he took his leave, and home he went<br>

Ah! Lord, so was he glad and well-begone!*                        *happy<br>

Cresside arose, no longer would she stent,*                        *stay<br>

But straight into her chamber went anon,<br>

And sat her down, as still as any stone,<br>

And ev'ry word gan up and down to wind<br>

That he had said, as it came to her mind.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02719">And wax'd somedeal astonish'd in her thought,<br>

Right for the newe case; but when that she<br>

*Was full advised,* then she found right naught   *had fully considered*<br>

Of peril, why she should afeared be:<br>

For a man may love, of possibility,<br>

A woman so, that his heart may to-brest,*                 *break utterly<br>

And she not love again, *but if her lest.*     *unless it so please her*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02720">But as she sat alone, and thoughte thus,<br>

In field arose a skirmish all without;<br>

And men cried in the street then:"<br>

With that gan all the meinie* for to shout:      *(Cressida's) household<br>

<p id="id02721">"For other way is from the gates none,<br>

Of Dardanus,&lt;18&gt; where open is the chain." &lt;19&gt;<br>

With that came he, and all his folk anon,<br>

An easy pace riding, in *routes twain,*                     *two troops*<br>

</p>

<p id="id02742">Antigone's song is of virtuous love for a noble object; and it is
singularly fitted to deepen the impression made on the mind of
Cressida by the brave aspect of Troilus, and by her own
cogitations. The singer, having praised the lover and rebuked
the revilers of love, proceeds:</p>

<p id="id02743">"What is the Sunne worse of his *kind right,*              *true nature*<br>

Now wot I well there is no pain therein."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02745">Cressida sighs, and asks Antigone whether there is such bliss
among these lovers, as they can fair endite; Antigone replies
confidently in the affirmative; and Cressida answers nothing,
"but every worde which she heard she gan to printen in her
hearte fast." Night draws on:</p>

<p id="id02746">The daye's honour, and the heaven's eye,<br>

And forth he flew, with hearte left for heart.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02750">Leaving Cressida to sleep, the poet returns to Troilus and his
zealous friend — with whose stratagems to bring the two lovers
together the remainder of the Second Book is occupied.
Pandarus counsels Troilus to write a letter to his mistress,
telling her how he "fares amiss," and "beseeching her of ruth;"
he will bear the letter to his niece; and, if Troilus will ride past
Cressida's house, he will find his mistress and his friend sitting
at a window. Saluting Pandarus, and not tarrying, his passage
will give occasion for some talk of him, which may make his
ears glow. With respect to the letter, Pandarus gives some
shrewd hints:</p>

<p id="id02751">"Touching thy letter, thou art wise enough,<br>

I wot thou *n'ilt it dignely endite*       *wilt not write it haughtily*<br>

Or make it with these argumentes tough,<br>

Nor scrivener-like, nor craftily it write;<br>

Beblot it with thy tears also a lite;*                           *little<br>

And if thou write a goodly word all soft,<br>

Though it be good, rehearse it not too oft.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02752">"For though the beste harper *pon live*                           *alive<br>

Would on the best y-sounded jolly harp<br>

That ever was, with all his fingers five<br>

Touch ay one string, or *ay one warble harp,*     *always play one tune*<br>

Were his nailes pointed ne'er so sharp,<br>

He shoulde maken ev'ry wight to dull*                     *to grow bored<br>

To hear his glee, and of his strokes full.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02753">"Nor jompre* eke no discordant thing y-fere,**        *jumble **together<br>

As thus, to use termes of physic;<br>

In love's termes hold of thy mattere<br>

The form alway, and *do that it be like;*           *make it consistent*<br>

For if a painter woulde paint a pike<br>

With ass's feet, and head it as an ape,&lt;32&gt;<br>

It *'cordeth not,* so were it but a jape."           *is not harmonious*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02754">Troilus writes the letter, and next morning Pandarus bears it to
Cressida. She refuses to receive "scrip or bill that toucheth such
mattere;" but he thrusts it into her bosom, challenging her to
throw it away. She retains it, takes the first opportunity of
escaping to her chamber to read it, finds it wholly good, and,
under her uncle's dictation, endites a reply telling her lover that
she will not make herself bound in love; "but as his sister, him
to please, she would aye fain [be glad] to do his heart an ease."
Pandarus, under pretext of inquiring who is the owner of the
house opposite, has gone to the window; Cressida takes her
letter to him there, and tells him that she never did a thing with
more pain than write the words to which he had constrained
her. As they sit side by side, on a stone of jasper, on a cushion
of beaten gold, Troilus rides by, in all his goodliness. Cressida
waxes "as red as rose," as she sees him salute humbly, "with
dreadful cheer, and oft his hues mue [change];" she likes "all
y-fere, his person, his array, his look, his cheer, his goodly
manner, and his gentleness;" so that, however she may have
been before, "to goode hope now hath she caught a thorn, she
shall not pull it out this nexte week." Pandarus, striking the iron
when it is hot, asks his niece to grant Troilus an interview; but
she strenuously declines, for fear of scandal, and because it is all
too soon to allow him so great a liberty — her purpose being to
love him unknown of all, "and guerdon [reward] him with
nothing but with sight." Pandarus has other intentions; and,
while Troilus writes daily letters with increasing love, he
contrives the means of an interview. Seeking out Deiphobus,
the brother of Troilus, he tells him that Cressida is in danger of
violence from Polyphete, and asks protection for her.
Deiphobus gladly complies, promises the protection of Hector
and Helen, and goes to invite Cressida to dinner on the morrow.
Meantime Pandarus instructs Troilus to go to the house of
Deiphobus, plead an access of his fever for remaining all night,
and keep his chamber next day. "Lo," says the crafty promoter
of love, borrowing a phrase from the hunting-field; "Lo, hold
thee at thy tristre [tryst &lt;33&gt;] close, and I shall well the deer
unto thy bowe drive." Unsuspicious of stratagem, Cressida
comes to dinner; and at table, Helen, Pandarus, and others,
praise the absent Troilus, until "her heart laughs" for very pride
that she has the love of such a knight. After dinner they speak
of Cressida's business; all confirm Deiphobus' assurances of
protection and aid; and Pandarus suggests that, since Troilus is
there, Cressida shall herself tell him her case. Helen and
Deiphobus alone accompany Pandarus to Troilus' chamber;
there Troilus produces some documents relating to the public
weal, which Hector has sent for his opinion; Helen and
Deiphobus, engrossed in perusal and discussion, roam out of
the chamber, by a stair, into the garden; while Pandarus goes
down to the hall, and, pretending that his brother and Helen are
still with Troilus, brings Cressida to her lover. The Second
Book leaves Pandarus whispering in his niece's ear counsel to
be merciful and kind to her lover, that hath for her such pain;
while Troilus lies "in a kankerdort," &lt;34&gt; hearing the
whispering without, and wondering what he shall say for this
"was the first time that he should her pray of love; O! mighty
God! what shall he say?"</p>

</p>

<p id="id02761">Knowing that Venus has set a law in the universe, that whoso
strives with her shall have the worse, the poet prays to be
taught to describe some of the joy that is felt in her service; and
the Third Book opens with an account of the scene between
Troilus and Cressida:</p>

<p id="id02762">Lay all this meane while Troilus<br>

Recording* his lesson in this mannere;                       *memorizing<br>

*"My fay!"* thought he, "thus will I say, and thus;       *by my faith!*<br>

Thus will I plain* unto my lady dear;                    *make my plaint<br>

That word is good; and this shall be my cheer<br>

This will I not forgetten in no wise;"<br>

God let him worken as he can devise.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02763">And, Lord! so as his heart began to quap,*                  *quake, pant<br>

Hearing her coming, and *short for to sike;*          *make short sighs*<br>

And Pandarus, that led her by the lap,*                           *skirt<br>

Came near, and gan in at the curtain pick,*                        *peep<br>

And saide: "God do boot* alle sick!                  *afford a remedy to<br>

See who is here you coming to visite;<br>

Lo! here is she that is *your death to wite!"*	*to blame for your death*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02764">Therewith it seemed as he wept almost.<br>

"Ah! ah! God help!" quoth Troilus ruefully;<br>

"Whe'er* me be woe, O mighty God, thou know'st!                 *whether<br>

Who is there? for I see not truely."<br>

"Sir," quoth Cresside, "it is Pandare and I;<br>

"Yea, sweete heart? alas, I may not rise<br>

To kneel and do you honour in some wise."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02765">And dressed him upward, and she right tho*                         *then<br>

"O! for the love of God, do ye not so<br>

For come I am to you for causes tway;*                              *two<br>

But, Lord! how he wax'd suddenly all red!<br>

And, Sir, his lesson, that he *ween'd have con,*        *thought he knew<br>

With look downcast, and humble *yielden cheer,*        *submissive face*<br>

Lo! *altherfirste word that him astert,*        *the first word he said*<br>

Was twice: "Mercy, mercy, my dear heart!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02769">And stent* a while; and when he might *out bring,*      *stopped *speak*<br>

The nexte was: "God wote, for I have,<br>

That shall I wreak* upon mine owne life,                         *avenge<br>

Right soon, I trow, and do your heart an ease,<br>

If with my death your heart I may appease:<br>

But, since that ye have heard somewhat say,<br>

Now reck I never how soon that I dey."                              *die<br>
</p>

<p id="id02771">Therewith his manly sorrow to behold<br>

It might have made a heart of stone to rue;<br>

And Pandare wept as he to water wo'ld, &lt;41&gt;<br>

And saide, "Woe-begone* be heartes true,"              *in woeful plight<br>

And procur'd* his niece ever new and new,                         *urged<br>

"For love of Godde, make *of him an end,*          *put him out of pain*<br>

"Ey! what?" quoth he; "that ye have on him ruth,*                  *pity<br>

For Godde's love, and do him not to dey."                           *die<br>

"Now thenne thus," quoth she, "I would him pray<br>

To telle me the *fine of his intent;*                *end of his desire*<br>

Yet wist* I never well what that he meant."                        *knew<br>
</p>

<p id="id02773">"What that I meane, sweete hearte dear?"<br>

Quoth Troilus, "O goodly, fresh, and free!<br>

<p id="id02777">With that she gan her eyen on him* cast, &lt;43&gt;                  *Pandarus<br>

Full easily and full debonairly,*                            *graciously<br>

<p id="id02780">"And shortly, deare heart, and all my knight,<br>

And him in armes took, and gan him kiss.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02781">Pandarus, almost beside himself for joy, falls on his knees to
thank Venus and Cupid, declaring that for this miracle he hears
all the bells ring; then, with a warning to be ready at his call to
meet at his house, he parts the lovers, and attends Cressida
while she takes leave of the household — Troilus all the time
groaning at the deceit practised on his brother and Helen. When
he has got rid of them by feigning weariness, Pandarus returns
to the chamber, and spends the night with him in converse. The
zealous friend begins to speak "in a sober wise" to Troilus,
reminding him of his love-pains now all at an end.</p>

<p id="id02782">"So that through me thou standest now in way<br>

To fare well; I say it for no boast;<br>

And know'st thou why? For, shame it is to say,<br>

For thee have I begun a game to play,<br>

Which that I never shall do eft* for other,**           *again **another<br>

Although he were a thousand fold my brother.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02783">"That is to say, for thee I am become,<br>

Betwixte game and earnest, such a mean*               *means, instrument<br>

As make women unto men to come;<br>

Thou know'st thyselfe what that woulde mean;<br>

For thee have I my niece, of vices clean,*                 *pure, devoid<br>

So fully made thy gentleness* to trust,              *nobility of nature<br>

That all shall be right *as thyselfe lust.*              *as you please*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02784">"But God, that *all wot,* take I to witness,          *knows everything*<br>

That never this for covetise* I wrought,                  *greed of gain<br>

But only to abridge* thy distress,                                *abate<br>

For which well nigh thou diedst, as me thought;<br>

But, goode brother, do now as thee ought,<br>

For Godde's love, and keep her out of blame;<br>

Since thou art wise, so save thou her name.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02785">"For, well thou know'st, the name yet of her,<br>

Among the people, as who saith hallow'd is;<br>

For that man is unborn, I dare well swear,<br>

That ever yet wist* that she did amiss;                            *knew<br>

But woe is me, that I, that cause all this,<br>

May thinke that she is my niece dear,<br>

And I her eme,* and traitor eke y-fere.**          *uncle &lt;17&gt; **as well<br>
</p>

<p id="id02786">"And were it wist that I, through mine engine,*       *arts, contrivance<br>

Had in my niece put this fantasy*                                 *fancy<br>

To do thy lust,* and wholly to be thine,                       *pleasure<br>

Why, all the people would upon it cry,<br>

And say, that I the worste treachery<br>

Did in this case, that ever was begun,<br>

And she fordone,* and thou right naught y-won."                  *ruined<br>
</p>

<p id="id02787">Therefore, ere going a step further, Pandarus prays Troilus to
give him pledges of secrecy, and impresses on his mind the
mischiefs that flow from vaunting in affairs of love. "Of
kind,"[by his very nature] he says, no vaunter is to be believed:</p>

<p id="id02788">"For a vaunter and a liar all is one;<br>

As thus: I pose* a woman granteth me                    *suppose, assume<br>

Her love, and saith that other will she none,<br>

And I am sworn to holden it secre,<br>

And, after, I go tell it two or three;<br>

Y-wis, I am a vaunter, at the least,<br>

And eke a liar, for I break my hest.*&lt;44&gt;                       *promise<br>
</p>

<p id="id02789">"Now looke then, if they be not to blame,<br>

Such manner folk; what shall I call them, what?<br>

That them avaunt of women, and by name,<br>

That never yet behight* them this nor that,              *promised (much<br>

Nor knowe them no more than mine old hat?                  less granted)<br>

No wonder is, so God me sende heal,*                         *prosperity<br>

Though women dreade with us men to deal!<br>
</p>

<p id="id02790">"I say not this for no mistrust of you,<br>

Nor for no wise men, but for fooles nice;*                   *silly &lt;45&gt;<br>

And for the harm that in the world is now,<br>

As well for folly oft as for malice;<br>

For well wot I, that in wise folk that vice<br>

No woman dreads, if she be well advised;<br>

For wise men be by fooles' harm chastised."*      *corrected, instructed<br>
</p>

<p id="id02791">So Pandarus begs Troilus to keep silent, promises to be true all
his days, and assures him that he shall have all that he will in the
love of Cressida: "thou knowest what thy lady granted thee; and
day is set the charters up to make."</p>

<p id="id02792">Who mighte telle half the joy and feast<br>

Which that the soul of Troilus then felt,<br>

Hearing th'effect of Pandarus' behest?<br>

His olde woe, that made his hearte swelt,*                   *faint, die<br>

Gan then for joy to wasten and to melt,<br>

And all the reheating &lt;46&gt; of his sighes sore<br>

At ones fled, he felt of them no more.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02793">But right so as these *holtes and these hayes,*       *woods and hedges*<br>

That have in winter deade been and dry,<br>

Reveste them in greene, when that May is,<br>

When ev'ry *lusty listeth* best to play;         *pleasant (one) wishes*<br>

Right in that selfe wise, sooth to say,<br>

Wax'd suddenly his hearte full of joy,<br>

That gladder was there never man in Troy.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02794">Troilus solemnly swears that never, "for all the good that God
made under sun," will he reveal what Pandarus asks him to keep
secret; offering to die a thousand times, if need were, and to
follow his friend as a slave all his life, in proof of his gratitude.</p>

<p id="id02795">"But here, with all my heart, I thee beseech,<br>

That never in me thou deeme* such folly                           *judge<br>

As I shall say; me thoughte, by thy speech,<br>

That this which thou me dost for company,*                   *friendship<br>

I shoulde ween it were a bawdery;*                      *a bawd's action<br>

*I am not wood, all if I lewed be;*                *I am not mad, though<br>

It is not one, that wot I well, pardie!                  I be unlearned*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02796">"But he that goes for gold, or for richess,<br>

On such messages, call him *as thee lust;*             *what you please*<br>

And this that thou dost, call it gentleness,<br>

Compassion, and fellowship, and trust;<br>

Depart it so, for widewhere is wist<br>

How that there is diversity requer'd<br>

Betwixte thinges like, as I have lear'd. &lt;47&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02797">"And that thou know I think it not nor ween,*                   *suppose<br>

That this service a shame be or a jape,             *subject for jeering<br>

I have my faire sister Polyxene,<br>

Cassandr', Helene, or any of the frape;*                       *set &lt;48&gt;<br>

Be she never so fair, or well y-shape,<br>

Telle me which thou wilt of ev'ry one,<br>

To have for thine, and let me then alone."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02798">Then, beseeching Pandarus soon to perform out the great
enterprise of crowning his love for Cressida, Troilus bade his
friend good night. On the morrow Troilus burned as the fire, for
hope and pleasure; yet "he not forgot his wise governance [self-
control];"</p>

<p id="id02799">But in himself with manhood gan restrain<br>

Each rakel* deed, and each unbridled cheer,**          *rash **demeanour<br>

That alle those that live, sooth to sayn,<br>

Should not have wist,* by word or by mannere,                 *suspicion<br>

What that he meant, as touching this mattere;<br>

From ev'ry wight as far as is the cloud<br>

He was, so well dissimulate he could.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02800">And all the while that I now devise*                  *describe, narrate<br>

This was his life: with all his fulle might,<br>

By day he was in Marte's high service,<br>

That is to say, in armes as a knight;<br>

And, for the moste part, the longe night<br>

He lay, and thought how that he mighte serve<br>

His lady best, her thank* for to deserve.                     *gratitude<br>
</p>

<p id="id02801">I will not swear, although he laye soft,<br>

That in his thought he n'as somewhat diseas'd;*                *troubled<br>

Nor that he turned on his pillows oft,<br>

And would of that him missed have been seis'd;*               *possessed<br>

But in such case men be not alway pleas'd,<br>

For aught I wot, no more than was he;<br>

That can I deem* of possibility.                                  *judge<br>
</p>

<p id="id02802">But certain is, to purpose for to go,<br>

That in this while, as written is in gest,*              *the history of<br>

He saw his lady sometimes, and also                         these events<br>

She with him spake, when that she *durst and lest;*  *dared and pleased*<br>

And, by their both advice,* as was the best,               *consultation<br>

*Appointed full warily* in this need,        *made careful preparations*<br>

So as they durst, how far they would proceed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02803">But it was spoken in *so short a wise,   *so briefly, and always in such<br>

In such await alway, and in such fear,       vigilance and fear of being<br>

Lest any wight divinen or devise*                   found out by anyone*<br>

Would of their speech, or to it lay an ear,<br>

*That all this world them not so lefe were,*      *they wanted more than<br>

As that Cupido would them grace send              anything in the world*<br>

To maken of their speeches right an end.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02804">But thilke little that they spake or wrought,<br>

His wise ghost* took ay of all such heed,                        *spirit<br>

It seemed her he wiste what she thought<br>

Withoute word, so that it was no need<br>

To bid him aught to do, nor aught forbid;<br>

For which she thought that love, all* came it late,            *although<br>

Of alle joy had open'd her the gate.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02805">Troilus, by his discretion, his secrecy, and his devotion, made
ever a deeper lodgment in Cressida's heart; so that she thanked
God twenty thousand times that she had met with a man who,
as she felt, "was to her a wall of steel, and shield from ev'ry
displeasance;" while Pandarus ever actively fanned the fire. So
passed a "time sweet" of tranquil and harmonious love the only
drawback being, that the lovers might not often meet, "nor
leisure have, their speeches to fulfil." At last Pandarus found an
occasion for bringing them together at his house unknown to
anybody, and put his plan in execution.</p>

<p id="id02806">For he, with great deliberation,<br>

Had ev'ry thing that hereto might avail*                  *be of service<br>

Forecast, and put in execution,<br>

And neither left for cost nor for travail;*                      *effort<br>

Come if them list, them shoulde nothing fail,<br>

*Nor for to be in aught espied there,<br>

That wiste he an impossible were.*           *he knew it was impossible*<br>

                                    that they could be discovered there*<br>

And dreadeless* it clear was in the wind                  *without doubt<br>

Of ev'ry pie, and every let-game; &lt;49&gt;<br>

Now all is well, for all this world is blind,<br>

In this mattere, bothe fremd* and tame; &lt;50&gt;                       *wild<br>

This timber is all ready for to frame;<br>

Us lacketh naught, but that we weete* wo'ld                        *know<br>

A certain hour in which we come sho'ld. &lt;51&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02807">Troilus had informed his household, that if at any time he was
missing, he had gone to worship at a certain temple of Apollo,
"and first to see the holy laurel quake, or that the godde spake
out of the tree." So, at the changing of the moon, when "the
welkin shope him for to rain," [when the sky was preparing to
rain] Pandarus went to invite his niece to supper; solemnly
assuring her that Troilus was out of the town — though all the
time he was safely shut up, till midnight, in "a little stew,"
whence through a hole he joyously watched the arrival of his
mistress and her fair niece Antigone, with half a score of her
women. After supper Pandaras did everything to amuse his
niece; "he sung, he play'd, he told a tale of Wade;" &lt;52&gt; at last
she would take her leave; but</p>

<p id="id02808">The bente Moone with her hornes pale,<br>

Saturn, and Jove, in Cancer joined were, &lt;53&gt;<br>

That made such a rain from heav'n avail,*                       *descend<br>

That ev'ry manner woman that was there<br>

Had of this smoky rain &lt;54&gt; a very fear;<br>

At which Pandarus laugh'd, and saide then<br>

"Now were it time a lady to go hen!"*                             *hence<br>
</p>

<p id="id02809">He therefore presses Cressida to remain all night; she complies
with a good grace; and after the sleeping cup has gone round,
all retire to their chambers — Cressida, that she may not be
disturbed by the rain and thunder, being lodged in the "inner
closet" of Pandarus, who, to lull suspicion, occupies the outer
chamber, his niece's women sleeping in the intermediate
apartment. When all is quiet, Pandarus liberates Troilus, and by
a secret passage brings him to the chamber of Cressida; then,
going forward alone to his niece, after calming her fears of
discovery, he tells her that her lover has "through a gutter, by a
privy went," [a secret passage] come to his house in all this rain,
mad with grief because a friend has told him that she loves
Horastes. Suddenly cold about her heart, Cressida promises that
on the morrow she will reassure her lover; but Pandarus scouts
the notion of delay, laughs to scorn her proposal to send her
ring in pledge of her truth, and finally, by pitiable accounts of
Troilus' grief, induces her to receive him and reassure him at
once with her own lips.</p>

<p id="id02810">This Troilus full soon on knees him set,<br>

Full soberly, right by her bedde's head,<br>

And in his beste wise his lady gret*                            *greeted<br>

But Lord! how she wax'd suddenly all red,<br>

And thought anon how that she would be dead;<br>

She coulde not one word aright out bring,<br>

So suddenly for his sudden coming.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02811">Cressida, though thinking that her servant and her knight should
not have doubted her truth, yet sought to remove his jealousy,
and offered to submit to any ordeal or oath he might impose;
then, weeping, she covered her face, and lay silent. "But now,"
exclaims the poet —</p>

<p id="id02812">But now help, God, to quenchen all this sorrow!<br>

So hope I that he shall, for he best may;<br>

For I have seen, of a full misty morrow,*                          *morn<br>

Followen oft a merry summer's day,<br>

And after winter cometh greene May;<br>

Folk see all day, and eke men read in stories,<br>

That after sharpe stoures* be victories.           *conflicts, struggles<br>
</p>

<p id="id02813">Believing his mistress to be angry, Troilus felt the cramp of
death seize on his heart, "and down he fell all suddenly in
swoon." Pandarus "into bed him cast," and called on his niece to
pull out the thorn that stuck in his heart, by promising that she
would "all forgive." She whispered in his ear the assurance that
she was not wroth; and at last, under her caresses, he recovered
consciousness, to find her arm laid over him, to hear the
assurance of her forgiveness, and receive her frequent kisses.
Fresh vows and explanations passed; and Cressida implored
forgiveness of "her own sweet heart," for the pain she had
caused him. Surprised with sudden bliss, Troilus put all in God's
hand, and strained his lady fast in his arms. "What might or may
the seely [innocent] larke say, when that the sperhawk
[sparrowhawk] hath him in his foot?"</p>

<p id="id02814">Cressida, which that felt her thus y-take,<br>

As write clerkes in their bookes old,<br>

Right as an aspen leaf began to quake,<br>

When she him felt her in his armes fold;<br>

But Troilus, all *whole of cares cold,*   *cured of painful sorrows*&lt;55&gt;<br>

Gan thanke then the blissful goddes seven. &lt;56&gt;<br>

Thus sundry paines bringe folk to heaven.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02815">This Troilus her gan in armes strain,<br>

And said, "O sweet, as ever may I go'n,*                        *prosper<br>

Now be ye caught, now here is but we twain,<br>

Now yielde you, for other boot* is none."                        *remedy<br>

To that Cresside answered thus anon,<br>

"N' had I ere now, my sweete hearte dear,<br>

*Been yolden,* y-wis, I were now not here!"             *yielded myself*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02816">O sooth is said, that healed for to be<br>

Of a fever, or other great sickness,<br>

Men drinken often pain and great distress!<br>

I mean it here, as for this adventure,<br>

That thorough pain hath founden all his cure.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02817">And now sweetnesse seemeth far more sweet,<br>

That bitterness assayed* was beforn;                        *tasted &lt;57&gt;<br>

For out of woe in blisse now they fleet,*                   *float, swim<br>

None such they felte since that they were born;<br>

Now is it better than both two were lorn! &lt;58&gt;<br>

For love of God, take ev'ry woman heed<br>

To worke thus, if it come to the need!<br>
</p>

<p id="id02818">Cresside, all quit from ev'ry dread and teen,*                     *pain<br>

Made him such feast,&lt;59&gt; it joy was for to see'n,<br>

When she his truth and *intent cleane wist;*            *knew the purity<br>

And as about a tree, with many a twist,                  of his purpose*<br>

*Bitrent and writhen* is the sweet woodbind,      *plaited and wreathed*<br>

Gan each of them in armes other wind.*                *embrace, encircle<br>

<p id="id02819">And as the *new abashed* nightingale,          *newly-arrived and timid*<br>

That stinteth,* first when she beginneth sing,                    *stops<br>

When that she heareth any *herde's tale,*    *the talking of a shepherd*<br>

Or in the hedges any wight stirring;<br>

And, after, sicker* out her voice doth ring;                *confidently<br>

Right so Cressida, when *her dreade stent,*           *her doubt ceased*<br>

Open'd her heart, and told him her intent.*                        *mind<br>

And suddenly *rescouse doth him escapen,*    *he is rescued and escapes*<br>

And from his death is brought *in sickerness;*               *to safety*<br>

For all the world, in such present gladness<br>

Was Troilus, and had his lady sweet;<br>

With worse hap God let us never meet!<br>
</p>

<p id="id02821">Her armes small, her straighte back and soft,<br>

Her sides longe, fleshly, smooth, and white,<br>

He gan to stroke; and good thrift* bade full oft               *blessing<br>

On her snow-white throat, her breastes round and lite;*           *small<br>

Thus in this heaven he gan him delight,<br>

And therewithal a thousand times her kist,<br>

That what to do for joy *unneth he wist.*               *he hardly knew*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02822">The lovers exchanged vows, and kisses, and embraces, and
speeches of exalted love, and rings; Cressida gave to Troilus a
brooch of gold and azure, "in which a ruby set was like a heart;"
and the too short night passed.</p>

<p id="id02823">"When that the cock, commune astrologer, &lt;60&gt;<br>

Gan on his breast to beat, and after crow,<br>

And Lucifer, the daye's messenger,<br>

And eastward rose, to him that could it know,<br>

Fortuna Major, &lt;61&gt; then anon Cresseide,<br>

With hearte sore, to Troilus thus said:<br>

</p>

<p id="id02831">The lovers part with many sighs and protestations of
unswerving and undying love; Cressida responding to the vows
of Troilus with the assurance —</p>

<p id="id02832">"That first shall Phoebus* falle from his sphere,               *the sun<br>

And heaven's eagle be the dove's fere,<br>

And ev'ry rock out of his place start,<br>

Ere Troilus out of Cressida's heart."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02833">When Pandarus visits Troilus in his palace later in the day, he
warns him not to mar his bliss by any fault of his own:</p>

<p id="id02834">"For, of Fortune's sharp adversity,<br>

The worste kind of infortune is this,<br>

A man to have been in prosperity,<br>

And it remember when it passed is.&lt;64&gt;<br>

Thou art wise enough; forthy,*" do not amiss;                 *therefore<br>

Be not too rakel,* though thou sitte warm;             *rash, over-hasty<br>

For if thou be, certain it will thee harm.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02835">"Thou art at ease, and hold thee well therein;<br>

For, all so sure as red is ev'ry fire,<br>

As great a craft is to keep weal as win; &lt;65&gt;<br>

Bridle alway thy speech and thy desire,<br>

For worldly joy holds not but by a wire;<br>

That proveth well, it breaks all day so oft,<br>

Forthy need is to worke with it soft."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02836">Troilus sedulously observes the counsel; and the lovers have
many renewals of their pleasure, and of their bitter chidings of
the Day. The effects of love on Troilus are altogether refining
and ennobling; as may be inferred from the song which he sung
often to Pandarus:</p>

<p id="id02837">The Second Song of Troilus.</p>

<p id="id02838">"Love, that of Earth and Sea hath governance!<br>

All this doth Love, ay heried* be his might!                    *praised<br>

</p>

<p id="id02842">But Troilus' love had higher fruits than singing:</p>

<p id="id02843">In alle needes for the towne's werre*                               *war<br>

And this increase of hardiness* and might                       *courage<br>

<p id="id02845" style="margin-top: 2em">And most of love and virtue was his speech,<br>

And *in despite he had all wretchedness*           *he held in scorn all<br>

To honour them that hadde worthiness,<br>

And ease them that weren in distress;<br>

And glad was he, if any wight well far'd,<br>

That lover was, when he it wist or heard.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02846">For he held every man lost unless he were in Love's service;

<h4 id="id02847" style="margin-top: 2em">THE FOURTH BOOK</h4>

<p id="id02848" style="margin-top: 2em">A BRIEF Proem to the Fourth Book prepares us for the
treachery of Fortune to Troilus; from whom she turned away
her bright face, and took of him no heed, "and cast him clean
out of his lady's grace, and on her wheel she set up Diomede."
Then the narrative describes a skirmish in which the Trojans
were worsted, and Antenor, with many of less note, remained in
the hands of the Greeks. A truce was proclaimed for the
exchange of prisoners; and as soon as Calchas heard the news,
he came to the assembly of the Greeks, to "bid a boon." Having
gained audience, he reminded the besiegers how he had come
from Troy to aid and encourage them in their enterprise; willing
to lose all that he had in the city, except his daughter Cressida,
whom he bitterly reproached himself for leaving behind. And
now, with streaming tears and pitiful prayer, he besought them
to exchange Antenor for Cressida; assuring them that the day
was at hand when they should have both town and people. The
soothsayer's petition was granted; and the ambassadors charged
to negotiate the exchange, entering the city, told their errand to
King Priam and his parliament.</p>

<p id="id02849">This Troilus was present in the place<br>

When asked was for Antenor Cresside;<br>

For which to change soon began his face,<br>

As he that with the wordes well nigh died;<br>

But natheless he no word to it seid;*                              *said<br>

Lest men should his affection espy,<br>

With manne's heart he gan his sorrows drie;*                     *endure<br>
</p>

<p id="id02850">And, full of anguish and of grisly dread,<br>

Abode what other lords would to it say,<br>

And if they woulde grant, — as God forbid! —<br>

Th'exchange of her, then thought he thinges tway:*                  *two<br>

First, for to save her honour; and what way<br>

He mighte best th'exchange of her withstand;<br>

This cast he then how all this mighte stand.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02851">Love made him alle *prest to do her bide,*      *eager to make her stay*<br>

And rather die than that she shoulde go;<br>

But Reason said him, on the other side,<br>

"Without th'assent of her, do thou not so,<br>

Lest for thy worke she would be thy foe;<br>

And say, that through thy meddling is y-blow*    *divulged, blown abroad<br>

Your bothe love, where it was *erst unknow."*       *previously unknown*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02852">For which he gan deliberate for the best,<br>

That though the lordes woulde that she went,<br>

He woulde suffer them grant what *them lest,*             *they pleased*<br>

And tell his lady first what that they meant;<br>

And, when that she had told him her intent,<br>

Thereafter would he worken all so blive,*                      *speedily<br>

Though all the world against it woulde strive.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02853">Hector, which that full well the Greekes heard,<br>

For Antenor how they would have Cresseide,<br>

Gan it withstand, and soberly answer'd;<br>

"Sirs, she is no prisoner,"  he said;<br>

"I know not on you who this charge laid;<br>

But, for my part, ye may well soon him tell,<br>

We use* here no women for to sell."                      *are accustomed<br>

<p id="id02854">The noise of the people then upstart at once,<br>

As breme* as blaze of straw y-set on fire              *violent, furious<br>

For Infortune* woulde for the nonce                          *Misfortune<br>

They shoulde their confusion desire<br>

"Hector," quoth they, "what ghost* may you inspire               *spirit<br>

This woman thus to shield, and *do us* lose                *cause us to*<br>

Dan Antenor? — a wrong way now ye choose, —<br>
</p>

<p id="id02855">"That is so wise, and eke so bold baroun;<br>

And we have need of folk, as men may see<br>

He eke is one the greatest of this town;<br>

O Hector! lette such fantasies be!<br>

O King Priam!" quoth they, "lo! thus say we,<br>

That all our will is to forego Cresseide;"<br>

And to deliver Antenor they pray'd.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02856">Though Hector often prayed them "nay," it was resolved that
Cressida should be given up for Antenor; then the parliament
dispersed. Troilus hastened home to his chamber, shut himself
up alone, and threw himself on his bed.</p>

<p id="id02857">And as in winter leaves be bereft,<br>

Each after other, till the tree be bare,<br>

So that there is but bark and branch y-left,<br>

Lay Troilus, bereft of each welfare,<br>

Y-bounden in the blacke bark of care,<br>

Disposed *wood out of his wit to braid,*       *to go out of his senses*<br>

*So sore him sat* the changing of Cresseide.        *so ill did he bear*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02858">He rose him up, and ev'ry door he shet,*                           *shut<br>

Upon his bedde's side adown him set,<br>

Full like a dead image, pale and wan,<br>

Accursed be that day which that Nature                     make me die?*<br>

Shope* me to be a living creature!"                              *shaped<br>
</p>

<p id="id02861">Bitterly reviling Fortune, and calling on Love to explain why his
happiness with Cressicla should be thus repealed, Troilus
declares that, while he lives, he will bewail his misfortune in
solitude, and will never see it shine or rain, but will end his
sorrowful life in darkness, and die in distress.</p>

<p id="id02862">"O weary ghost, that errest to and fro!<br>

Why n'ilt* thou fly out of the woefulest                       *wilt not<br>

<p id="id02865">"O old, unwholesome, and mislived man,<br>

O Calchas! which that will my bane* be,                     *destruction<br>

In cursed time wert thou born for me!<br>

As woulde blissful Jove, for his joy,<br>

That I thee hadde where I would in Troy!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02866">Soon Troilus, through excess of grief, fell into a trance; in
which he was found by Pandarus, who had gone almost
distracted at the news that Cressida was to be exchanged for
Antenor. At his friend's arrival, Troilus "gan as the snow against
the sun to melt;" the two mingled their tears a while; then
Pandarus strove to comfort the woeful lover. He admitted that
never had a stranger ruin than this been wrought by Fortune:</p>

<p id="id02867">"But tell me this, why thou art now so mad<br>

To sorrow thus? Why li'st thou in this wise,<br>

Since thy desire all wholly hast thou had,<br>

So that by right it ought enough suffice?<br>

But I, that never felt in my service<br>

A friendly cheer or looking of an eye,<br>

Let me thus weep and wail until I die. &lt;70&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02868">"And over all this, as thou well wost* thy selve,               *knowest<br>

This town is full of ladies all about,<br>

And, *to my doom,* fairer than suche twelve             *in my judgment*<br>

As ever she was, shall I find in some rout,*                    *company<br>

Yea! one or two, withouten any doubt:<br>

Forthy* be glad, mine owen deare brother!                     *therefore<br>

If she be lost, we shall recover another.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02869">"What! God forbid alway that each pleasance<br>

If this be goodly, she is glad and light;<br>

And this is fair, and that can good aright;<br>

Each for his virtue holden is full dear,<br>

Both heroner, and falcon for rivere. &lt;71&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02870">"And eke as writ Zausis,&lt;72&gt; that was full wise,<br>

The newe love out chaseth oft the old,<br>

Absence of her shall drive her out of heart."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02872">These wordes said he *for the nones all,*           *only for the nonce*<br>

To help his friend, lest he for sorrow died;<br>

For, doubteless, to do his woe to fall,*          *make his woe subside*<br>

He raughte* not what unthrift** that he said;             *cared **folly<br>

But Troilus, that nigh for sorrow died,<br>

Took little heed of all that ever he meant;<br>

One ear it heard, at th'other out it went.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02873">But, at the last, he answer'd and said,<br>

"Friend, This leachcraft, or y-healed thus to be,<br>

Were well sitting* if that I were a fiend,                       *recked<br>

To traisen* her that true is unto me:                            *betray<br>

I pray God, let this counsel never the,*                         *thrive<br>

But do me rather sterve* anon right here,                           *die<br>

Ere I thus do, as thou me wouldest lear!"*                        *teach<br>
</p>

<p id="id02874">Troilus protests that his lady shall have him wholly hers till
death; and, debating the counsels of his friend, declares that
even if he would, he could not love another. Then he points out
the folly of not lamenting the loss of Cressida because she had
been his in ease and felicity —  while Pandarus himself, though
he thought it so light to change to and fro in love, had not done
busily his might to change her that wrought him all the woe of
his unprosperous suit.</p>

<p id="id02875">"If thou hast had in love ay yet mischance,<br>

And canst it not out of thine hearte drive,<br>

I that lived in lust* and in pleasance                          *delight<br>

With her, as much as creature alive,<br>

How should I that forget, and that so blive?*                   *quickly<br>

O where hast thou been so long hid in mew,*&lt;74&gt;                    *cage<br>

That canst so well and formally argue!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02876">The lover condemns the whole discourse of his friend as
unworthy, and calls on Death, the ender of all sorrows, to come
to him and quench his heart with his cold stroke. Then he distils
anew in tears, "as liquor out of alembic;" and Pandarus is silent
for a while, till he bethinks him to recommend to Troilus the
carrying off of Cressida. "Art thou in Troy, and hast no
hardiment [daring, boldness] to take a woman which that loveth
thee?"  But Troilus reminds his counsellor that all the war had
come from the ravishing of a woman by might (the abduction of
Helen by Paris); and that it would not beseem him to withstand
his father's grant, since the lady was to be changed for the
town's good. He has dismissed the thought of asking Cressida
from his father, because that would be to injure her fair fame, to
no purpose, for Priam could not overthrow the decision of "so
high a place as parliament;" while most of all he fears to perturb
her heart with violence, to the slander of her name — for he
must hold her honour dearer than himself in every case, as
lovers ought of right:</p>

<p id="id02877">"Thus am I in desire and reason twight:*                        *twisted<br>

</p>

<p id="id02879">Pandare answered, "Friend, thou may'st for me<br>

</p>

<p id="id02885">Pandarus promises his friend all aid in the enterprise; it is agreed
that Cressida shall be carried off, but only with her own
consent; and Pandarus sets out for his niece's house, to arrange
an interview. Meantime Cressida has heard the news; and,
caring nothing for her father, but everything for Troilus, she
burns in love and fear, unable to tell what she shall do.</p>

<p id="id02886">But, as men see in town, and all about,<br>

That women use* friendes to visite,                      *are accustomed<br>

So to Cresside of women came a rout,*                             *troop<br>

For piteous joy, and *weened her delight,*       *thought to please her*<br>

And with their tales, *dear enough a mite,*           *not worth a mite*<br>

These women, which that in the city dwell,<br>

They set them down, and said as I shall tell.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02887">Quoth first that one, "I am glad, truely,<br>

Because of you, that shall your father see;"<br>

Another said, "Y-wis, so am not I,<br>

For all too little hath she with us be."*                          *been<br>

Quoth then the third, "I hope, y-wis, that she<br>

Shall bringen us the peace on ev'ry side;<br>

Then, when she goes, Almighty God her guide!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02888">Those wordes, and those womanishe thinges,<br>

She heard them right as though she thennes* were,       *thence; in some<br>

For, God it wot, her heart on other thing is;                other place<br>

Although the body sat among them there,<br>

Her advertence* is always elleswhere;                         *attention<br>

Withoute word, on him alway she thought.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02889">These women that thus weened her to please,<br>

Aboute naught gan all their tales spend;<br>

Such vanity ne can do her no ease,<br>

As she that all this meane while brenn'd<br>

Of other passion than that they wend;*                 *weened, supposed<br>

So that she felt almost her hearte die<br>

For woe, and weary* of that company.                          *weariness<br>
</p>

<p id="id02890">For whiche she no longer might restrain<br>

She fallen was, since she forwent* the sight                       *lost<br>

Depart, and never playe with them more;<br>

And they that hadde knowen her of yore<br>

<p id="id02892">And busily they gonnen* her comfort                               *began<br>

And with their tales weened her disport,<br>

And to be glad they her besought;<br>

But such an ease therewith they in her wrought,<br>

Right as a man is eased for to feel,<br>

For ache of head, to claw him on his heel.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02893">But, after all this nice* vanity,                                 *silly<br>

They took their leave, and home they wenten all;<br>

Cressida, full of sorrowful pity,<br>

Into her chamber up went out of the hall,<br>

And on her bed she gan for dead to fall,<br>

In purpose never thennes for to rise;<br>

And thus she wrought, as I shall you devise.*                   *narrate<br>
</p>

<p id="id02894">She rent her sunny hair, wrung her hands, wept, and bewailed
her fate; vowing that, since, "for the cruelty," she could handle
neither sword nor dart, she would abstain from meat and drink
until she died. As she lamented, Pandarus entered, making her
complain a thousand times more at the thought of all the joy
which he had given her with her lover; but he somewhat
soothed her by the prospect of Troilus's visit, and by the
counsel to contain her grief when he should come. Then
Pandarus went in search of Troilus, whom he found solitary in a
temple, as one that had ceased to care for life:</p>

<p id="id02895">For right thus was his argument alway:<br>

He said he was but lorne,* well-away!                      *lost, ruined<br>

"For all that comes, comes by necessity;<br>

Thus, to be lorn,* it is my destiny.                       *lost, ruined<br>
</p>

<p id="id02896">"For certainly this wot I well," he said,<br>

"That foresight of the divine purveyance*                    *providence<br>

Hath seen alway me to forgo* Cresseide,                            *lose<br>

Since God sees ev'ry thing, *out of doubtance,*          *without doubt*<br>

That be purvey'd; but needly, as they sayn,<br>

Behoveth it that thinges, which that fall,<br>

That they in certain be purveyed all.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02903">"I mean as though I labour'd me in this<br>

To inquire which thing cause of which thing be;<br>

Of thinges that to come be, pardie!<br>

Or if necessity of thing coming<br>

Be cause certain of the purveying.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02904">"But now *enforce I me not* in shewing             *I do not lay stress*<br>

How th'order of causes stands; but well wot I,<br>

That it behoveth, that the befalling<br>

<p id="id02905">"For, if there sit a man yond on a see,*                           *seat<br>

And, furtherover, now againward yet,<br>

Lo! right so is it on the part contrary;<br>

As thus, — now hearken, for I will not tarry; —<br>
</p>

<p id="id02906">"I say that if th'opinion of thee<br>

Be sooth, for that he sits, then say I this,<br>

That he must sitte by necessity;<br>

And thus necessity in either is,<br>

And, in thee, need of sooth; and thus forsooth<br>

There must necessity be in you both.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02907">"But thou may'st say he sits not therefore<br>

That thine opinion of his sitting sooth<br>

But rather, for the man sat there before,<br>

Therefore is thine opinion sooth, y-wis;<br>

And I say, though the cause of sooth of this<br>

Is interchanged both in him and thee.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02908">"Thus in the same wise, out of doubtance,<br>

I may well maken, as it seemeth me,<br>

<p id="id02913">While Troilus was in all this heaviness, disputing with himself in
this matter, Pandarus joined him, and told him the result of the
interview with Cressida; and at night the lovers met, with what
sighs and tears may be imagined. Cressida swooned away, so
that Troilus took her for dead; and, having tenderly laid out her
limbs, as one preparing a corpse for the bier, he drew his sword
to slay himself upon her body. But, as God would, just at that
moment she awoke out of her swoon; and by and by the pair
began to talk of their prospects. Cressida declared the opinion,
supporting it at great length and with many reasons, that there
was no cause for half so much woe on either part. Her
surrender, decreed by the parliament, could not be resisted; it
was quite easy for them soon to meet again; she would bring
things about that she should be back in Troy within a week or
two; she would take advantage of the constant coming and
going while the truce lasted; and the issue would be, that the
Trojans would have both her and Antenor; while, to facilitate
her return, she had devised a stratagem by which, working on
her father's avarice, she might tempt him to desert from the
Greek camp back to the city. "And truly," says the poet, having
fully reported her plausible speech,</p>

<p id="id02914">And truely, as written well I find,<br>

That all this thing was said *of good intent,*               *sincerely*<br>

And that her hearte true was and kind<br>

Towardes him, and spake right as she meant,<br>

And that she starf* for woe nigh when she went,                    *died<br>

And was in purpose ever to be true;<br>

Thus write they that of her workes knew.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02915">This Troilus, with heart and ears y-sprad,*                    *all open<br>

Heard all this thing devised to and fro,<br>

And verily it seemed that he had<br>

*The selfe wit;* but yet to let her go                *the same opinion*<br>

His hearte misforgave* him evermo';                             *misgave<br>

But, finally, he gan his hearte wrest*                           *compel<br>

To truste her, and took it for the best.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02916">For which the great fury of his penance*                      *suffering<br>

Was quench'd with hope, and therewith them between<br>

Began for joy the amorouse dance;<br>

And as the birdes, when the sun is sheen,                        *bright<br>

Delighten in their song, in leaves green,<br>

Right so the wordes that they spake y-fere*                    *together<br>

Delighten them, and make their heartes cheer.*                     *glad<br>
</p>

<p id="id02917">Yet Troilus was not so well at ease, that he did not earnestly
entreat Cressida to observe her promise; for, if she came not
into Troy at the set day, he should never have health, honour, or
joy; and he feared that the stratagem by which she would try to
lure her father back would fail, so that she might be compelled
to remain among the Greeks. He would rather have them steal
away together, with sufficient treasure to maintain them all their
lives; and even if they went in their bare shirt, he had kin and
friends elsewhere, who would welcome and honour them.</p>

<p id="id02918">Cressida, with a sigh, right in this wise<br>

Answer'd; "Y-wis, my deare hearte true,<br>

We may well steal away, as ye devise,<br>

And finde such unthrifty wayes new;<br>

But afterward full sore *it will us rue;*            *we will regret it*<br>

Be false to you, my Troilus, my knight,<br>

Saturne's daughter Juno, through her might,<br>

As wood* as Athamante &lt;78&gt; do me dwell                              *mad<br>

Eternally in Styx the pit of hell!<br>
</p>

<p id="id02920">"And this, on ev'ry god celestial<br>

I swear it you, and eke on each goddess,<br>

On ev'ry nymph, and deity infernal,<br>

On Satyrs and on Faunes more or less,<br>

That *halfe goddes* be of wilderness;                          *demigods<br>

And Atropos my thread of life to-brest,*                  *break utterly<br>

If I be false! now trow* me if you lest.**             *believe **please<br>

<p id="id02921">"And thou Simois, &lt;79&gt; that as an arrow clear<br>

That thilke day that I untrue be<br>

To Troilus, mine owen hearte free,<br>

That thou returne backward to thy well,<br>

And I with body and soul sink in hell!"<br>
</p>

<p id="id02922">Even yet Troilus was not wholly content, and urged anew his
plan of secret flight; but Cressida turned upon him with the
charge that he mistrusted her causelessly, and demanded of him
that he should be faithful in her absence, else she must die at her
return. Troilus promised faithfulness in far simpler and briefer
words than Cressida had used.</p>

<p id="id02923">"Grand mercy, good heart mine, y-wis," quoth she;<br>

"And blissful Venus let me never sterve,*                           *die<br>

<p id="id02927">The lovers took a heart-rending adieu; and Troilus, suffering
unimaginable anguish, "withoute more, out of the chamber
went."</p>

</p>

<p id="id02931">In the morning, Diomede was ready to escort Cressida to the
Greek host; and Troilus, seeing him mount his horse, could with
difficulty resist an impulse to slay him — but restrained himself,
lest his lady should be also slain in the tumult. When Cressida
was ready to go,</p>

<p id="id02932">This Troilus, in guise of courtesy,<br>

With hawk on hand, and with a huge rout*                 *retinue, crowd<br>

Of knightes, rode, and did her company,<br>

Passing alle the valley far without;<br>

And farther would have ridden, out of doubt,<br>

Full fain,* and woe was him to go so soon,                       *gladly<br>

But turn he must, and it was eke to do'n.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02933">And right with that was Antenor y-come<br>

Out of the Greekes' host, and ev'ry wight<br>

Was of it glad, and said he was welcome;<br>

And Troilus, *all n'ere his hearte light,*           *although his heart<br>

He pained him, with all his fulle might,                  was not light*<br>

Him to withhold from weeping at the least;<br>

And Antenor he kiss'd and made feast.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02934">And therewithal he must his leave take,<br>

And cast his eye upon her piteously,<br>

And near he rode, his cause* for to make               *excuse, occasion<br>

To take her by the hand all soberly;<br>

And, Lord! so she gan weepe tenderly!<br>

And he full soft and slily gan her say,<br>

"Now hold your day, and *do me not to dey."*        *do not make me die*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02935">With that his courser turned he about,<br>

With face pale, and unto Diomede<br>

No word he spake, nor none of all his rout;<br>

Of which the son of Tydeus &lt;81&gt; tooke heed,<br>

As he that couthe* more than the creed &lt;82&gt;                        *knew<br>

In such a craft, and by the rein her hent;*                        *took<br>

And Troilus to Troye homeward went.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02936">This Diomede, that led her by the bridle,<br>

When that he saw the folk of Troy away,<br>

Thought, "All my labour shall not be *on idle,*               *in  vain*<br>

If that I may, for somewhat shall I say;<br>

For, at the worst, it may yet short our way;<br>

I have heard say eke, times twice twelve,<br>

He is a fool that will forget himselve."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02937">But natheless, this thought he well enough,<br>

That "Certainly I am aboute naught,<br>

If that I speak of love, or *make it tough;*           *make any violent<br>

For, doubteless, if she have in her thought            immediate effort*<br>

Him that I guess, he may not be y-brought<br>

So soon away; but I shall find a mean,<br>

That she *not wit as yet shall* what I mean."       *shall not yet know*<br>
</p>

<p id="id02938">So he began a general conversation, assured her of not less
friendship and honour among the Greeks than she had enjoyed
in Troy, and requested of her earnestly to treat him as a brother
and accept his service — for, at last he said, "I am and shall be
ay, while that my life may dure, your own, aboven ev'ry
creature.</p>

<p id="id02939">"Thus said I never e'er now to woman born;<br>

For, God mine heart as wisly* gladden so!                        *surely<br>

I loved never woman herebeforn,<br>

As paramours, nor ever shall no mo';<br>

And for the love of God be not my foe,<br>

All* can I not to you, my lady dear,                           *although<br>

Complain aright, for I am yet to lear.*                           *teach<br>

<p id="id02940">"And wonder not, mine owen lady bright,<br>

Though that I speak of love to you thus blive;*                    *soon<br>

For I have heard ere this of many a wight<br>

That loved thing he ne'er saw in his live;<br>

Eke I am not of power for to strive<br>

Against the god of Love, but him obey<br>

I will alway, and mercy I you pray."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02941">Cressida answered his discourses as though she scarcely heard
them; yet she thanked him for his trouble and courtesy, and
accepted his offered friendship — promising to trust him, as well
she might. Then she alighted from her steed, and, with her heart
nigh breaking, was welcomed to the embrace of her father.
Meanwhile Troilus, back in Troy, was lamenting with tears the
loss of his love, despairing of his or her ability to survive the ten
days, and spending the night in wailing, sleepless tossing, and
troublous dreams. In the morning he was visited by Pandarus,
to whom he gave directions for his funeral; desiring that the
powder into which his heart was burned should be kept in a
golden urn, and given to Cressida. Pandarus renewed his old
counsels and consolations, reminded his friend that ten days
were a short time to wait, argued against his faith in evil
dreams, and urged him to take advantage of the truce, and
beguile the time by a visit to King Sarpedon (a Lycian Prince
who had come to aid the Trojans). Sarpedon entertained them
splendidly; but no feasting, no pomp, no music of instruments,
no singing of fair ladies, could make up for the absence of
Cressida to the desolate Troilus, who was for ever poring upon
her old letters, and recalling her loved form. Thus he "drove to
an end" the fourth day, and would have then returned to Troy,
but for the remonstrances of Pandarus, who asked if they had
visited Sarpedon only to fetch fire? At last, at the end of a
week, they returned to Troy; Troilus hoping to find Cressida
again in the city, Pandarus entertaining a scepticism which he
concealed from his friend. The morning after their return,
Troilus was impatient till he had gone to the palace of Cressida;
but when he found her doors all closed, "well nigh for sorrow
adown he gan to fall."</p>

<p id="id02942">Therewith, when he was ware, and gan behold<br>

How shut was ev'ry window of the place,<br>

As frost him thought his hearte *gan to cold;*      *began to grow cold*<br>

For which, with changed deadly pale face,<br>

Withoute word, he forth began to pace;<br>

And, as God would, he gan so faste ride,<br>

That no wight of his countenance espied.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02943">Then said he thus: "O palace desolate!<br>

O house of houses, *whilom beste hight!*          *formerly called best*<br>

O palace empty and disconsolate!<br>

O thou lantern, of which quench'd is the light!<br>

O palace, whilom day, that now art night!<br>

Well oughtest thou to fall, and I to die,<br>

Since she is gone that wont was us to guy!*                 *guide, rule<br>

</p>

<p id="id02945">.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .</p>

<p id="id02946">From thence forth he rideth up and down,<br>

And ev'ry thing came him to remembrance,<br>

As he rode by the places of the town,<br>

In which he whilom had all his pleasance;<br>

"Lo! yonder saw I mine own lady dance;<br>

And in that temple, with her eyen clear,<br>

Me caughte first my righte lady dear.<br>
</p>

<p id="id02947">"And yonder have I heard full lustily<br>

My deare hearte laugh; and yonder play:<br>

Saw I her ones eke full blissfully;<br>

And yonder ones to me gan she say,<br>

'Now, goode sweete! love me well, I pray;'<br>

And yond so gladly gan she me behold,<br>

That to the death my heart is to her hold.*               *holden, bound<br>
</p>

<p id="id02948">"And at that corner, in the yonder house,<br>

Heard I mine allerlevest* lady dear,                     *dearest of all<br>

So womanly, with voice melodious,<br>

Singe so well, so goodly and so clear,<br>

That in my soule yet me thinks I hear<br>

The blissful sound; and in that yonder place<br>

My lady first me took unto her grace."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02949">Then he went to the gates, and gazed along the way by which
he had attended Cressida at her departure; then he fancied that
all the passers-by pitied him; and thus he drove forth a day or
two more, singing a song, of few words, which he had made to
lighten his heart:</p>

<p id="id02950">"O star, of which I lost have all the light,<br>

With hearte sore well ought I to bewail,<br>

That ever dark in torment, night by night,<br>

Toward my death, with wind I steer and sail;<br>

For which, the tenthe night, if that I fail*      *miss; be left without<br>

The guiding of thy beames bright an hour,<br>

My ship and me Charybdis will devour."<br>
</p>

<p id="id02951">By night he prayed the moon to run fast about her sphere; by
day he reproached the tardy sun — dreading that Phaethon had
come to life again, and was driving the chariot of Apollo out of
its straight course. Meanwhile Cressida, among the Greeks, was
bewailing the refusal of her father to let her return, the certainty
that her lover would think her false, and the hopelessness of any
attempt to steal away by night. Her bright face waxed pale, her
limbs lean, as she stood all day looking toward Troy; thinking
on her love and all her past delights, regretting that she had not
followed the counsel of Troilus to steal away with him, and
finally vowing that she would at all hazards return to the city.
But she was fated, ere two months, to be full far from any such
intention; for Diomede now brought all his skill into play, to
entice Cressida into his net. On the tenth day, Diomede, "as
fresh as branch in May," came to the tent of Cressida, feigning
business with Calchas.</p>

<p id="id02952">Cresside, at shorte wordes for to tell,<br>

Granted upon the morrow, at his request,<br>

<p id="id02964">As she that had her heart on Troilus<br>

So faste set, that none might it arace;*                    *uproot &lt;83&gt;<br>

"O Diomede! I love that ilke place<br>

Deliver it soon of all that doth it care!*                      *afflict<br>

</p>

<p id="id02965">She knows that the Greeks would fain wreak their wrath on
Troy, if they might; but that shall never befall: she knows that
there are Greeks of high condition — though as worthy men
would be found in Troy: and she knows that Diomede could
serve his lady well.</p>

<p id="id02966">"But, as to speak of love, y-wis," she said,<br>

"I had a lord, to whom I wedded was, &lt;84&gt;<br>

And after this, the story telleth us<br>

That she him gave the faire baye steed<br>

That Troilus' was, she gave this Diomede;<br>

She made him wear a pensel* of her sleeve.                 *pendant &lt;86&gt;<br>
</p>

<p id="id02973">I find eke in the story elleswhere,<br>

When through the body hurt was Diomede<br>

By Troilus, she wept many a tear,<br>

When that she saw his wide woundes bleed,<br>

And that she took to keepe* him good heed,               *tend, care for<br>

And, for to heal him of his sorrow's smart,<br>

Men say, I n'ot,* that she gave him her heart.                 *know not<br>
</p>

<p id="id02974">And yet, when pity had thus completed the triumph of
inconstancy, she made bitter moan over her falseness to one of
the noblest and worthiest men that ever was; but it was now too
late to repent, and at all events she resolved that she would be
true to Diomede — all the while weeping for pity of the absent
Troilus, to whom she wished every happiness. The tenth day,
meantime, had barely dawned, when Troilus, accompanied by
Pandarus, took his stand on the walls, to watch for the return of
Cressida. Till noon they stood, thinking that every corner from
afar was she; then Troilus said that doubtless her old father bore
the parting ill, and had detained her till after dinner; so they
went to dine, and returned to their vain observation on the
walls. Troilus invented all kinds of explanations for his
mistress's delay; now, her father would not let her go till eve;
now, she would ride quietly into the town after nightfall, not to
be observed; now, he must have mistaken the day. For five or
six days he watched, still in vain, and with decreasing hope.
Gradually his strength decayed, until he could walk only with a
staff; answering the wondering inquiries of his friends, by saying
that he had a grievous malady about his heart. One day he
dreamed that in a forest he saw Cressida in the embrace of a
boar; and he had no longer doubt of her falsehood. Pandarus,
however, explained away the dream to mean merely that
Cressida was detained by her father, who might be at the point
of death; and he counselled the disconsolate lover to write a
letter, by which he might perhaps get at the truth. Troilus
complied, entreating from his mistress, at the least, a "letter of
hope;" and the lady answered, that she could not come now, but
would so soon as she might; at the same time "making him great
feast," and swearing that she loved him best — "of which he
found but bottomless behest [which he found but groundless
promises]." Day by day increased the woe of Troilus; he laid
himself in bed, neither eating, nor drinking, nor sleeping, nor
speaking, almost distracted by the thought of Cressida's
unkindness. He related his dream to his sister Cassandra, who
told him that the boar betokened Diomede, and that,
wheresoever his lady was, Diornede certainly had her heart, and
she was his: "weep if thou wilt, or leave, for, out of doubt, this
Diomede is in, and thou art out." Troilus, enraged, refused to
believe Cassandra's interpretation; as well, he cried, might such
a story be credited of Alcestis, who devoted her life for her
husband; and in his wrath he started from bed, "as though all
whole had him y-made a leach [physician]," resolving to find
out the truth at all hazards. The death of Hector meanwhile
enhanced the sorrow which he endured; but he found time to
write often to Cressida, beseeching her to come again and hold
her truth; till one day his false mistress, out of pity, wrote him
again, in these terms:</p>

<p id="id02980">Though he found this letter "all strange," and thought it like "a
kalendes of change," &lt;88&gt; Troilus could not believe his lady so
cruel as to forsake him; but he was put out of all doubt, one day
that, as he stood in suspicion and melancholy, he saw a "coat-
armour" borne along the street, in token of victory, before
Deiphobus his brother. Deiphobus had won it from Diomede in
battle that day; and Troilus, examining it out of curiosity, found
within the collar a brooch which he had given to Cressida on the
morning she left Troy, and which she had pledged her faith to
keep for ever in remembrance of his sorrow and of him. At this
fatal discovery of his lady's untruth,</p>

<p id="id02981">Great was the sorrow and plaint of Troilus;<br>

But forth her course Fortune ay gan to hold;<br>

<p id="id02982">In many a cruel battle Troilus wrought havoc among the
Greeks, and often he exchanged blows and bitter words with
Diomede, whom he always specially sought; but it was not their
lot that either should fall by the other's hand. The poet's
purpose, however, he tells us, is to relate, not the warlike deeds
of Troilus, which Dares has fully told, but his love-fortunes:</p>

<p id="id02983">Beseeching ev'ry lady bright of hue,<br>

And ev'ry gentle woman, *what she be,*               *whatsoever she be*<br>

<p id="id02999" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to Troilus and Cressida</p>

<p id="id03000" style="margin-top: 2em">1. The double sorrow: First his suffering before his love was
successful; and then his grief after his lady had been separated
from him, and had proved unfaithful.</p>

<p id="id03001">2. Tisiphone: one of the Eumenides, or Furies, who avenged on
men in the next world the crimes committed on earth. Chaucer
makes this grim invocation most fitly, since the Trojans were
under the curse of the Eumenides, for their part in the offence
of Paris in carrying off Helen, the wife of his host Menelaus,
and thus impiously sinning against the laws of hospitality.</p>

<p id="id03002">3. See Chaucer's description of himself in "The House Of
Fame," and note 11 to that poem.</p>

<p id="id03003">4. The Palladium, or image of Pallas (daughter of Triton and
foster-sister of Athena), was said to have fallen from heaven at
Troy, where Ilus was just beginning to found the city; and Ilus
erected a sanctuary, in which it was preserved with great
honour and care, since on its safety was supposed to depend the
safety of the city. In later times a Palladium was any statue of
the goddess Athena kept for the safeguard of the city that
possessed it.</p>

<p id="id03004">5. "Oh, very god!": oh true divinity! — addressing Cressida.</p>

<p id="id03005">6. Ascaunce: as if to say — as much as to say. The word
represents "Quasi dicesse" in Boccaccio. See note 5 to the
Sompnour's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03006">7. Eft: another reading is "oft."</p>

<p id="id03007">8. Arten: constrain — Latin, "arceo."</p>

<p id="id03008">9. The song is a translation of Petrarch's 88th Sonnet, which
opens thus:
"S'amor non e, che dunque e quel ch'i'sento."</p>

<p id="id03009">10. If maugre me: If (I burn) in spite of myself. The usual
reading is, "If harm agree me" = if my hurt contents me: but
evidently the antithesis is lost which Petrarch intended when,
after "s'a mia voglia ardo," he wrote "s'a mal mio grado" = if
against my will; and Urry's Glossary points out the probability
that in transcription the words "If that maugre me" may have
gradually changed into "If harm agre me."</p>

<p id="id03010">11. The Third of May seems either to have possessed peculiar
favour or significance with Chaucer personally, or to have had a
special importance in connection with those May observances
of which the poet so often speaks. It is on the third night of
May that Palamon, in The Knight's Tale, breaks out of prison,
and at early morn encounters in the forest Arcita, who has gone
forth to pluck a garland in honour of May; it is on the third
night of May that the poet hears the debate of "The Cuckoo and
the Nightingale"; and again in the present passage the favoured
date recurs.</p>

<p id="id03011">12. Went: turning; from Anglo-Saxon, "wendan;" German,
"wenden." The turning and tossing of uneasy lovers in bed is,
with Chaucer, a favourite symptom of their passion. See the
fifth "statute," in The Court of Love.</p>

<p id="id03012">13. Procne, daughter of Pandion, king of Attica, was given to
wife to Tereus in reward for his aid against an enemy; but
Tereus dishonoured Philomela, Procne's sister; and his wife, in
revenge, served up to him the body of his own child by her.
Tereus, infuriated, pursued the two sisters, who prayed the
gods to change them into birds. The prayer was granted;
Philomela became a nightingale, Procne a swallow, and Tereus
a hawk.</p>

<p id="id03013">14. Fished fair: a proverbial phrase which probably may be best
represented by the phrase "done great execution."</p>

<p id="id03014">15. The fair gem virtueless:  possessing none of the virtues
which in the Middle Ages were universally believed to be
inherent in precious stones.</p>

<p id="id03015">16. The crop and root: the most perfect example. See note 29
to the Knight's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03016">17. Eme: uncle; the mother's brother; still used in Lancashire.
Anglo-Saxon, "eame;" German, "Oheim."</p>

<p id="id03017">18. Dardanus: the mythical ancestor of the Trojans, after whom
the gate is supposed to be called.</p>

<p id="id03018">19. All the other gates were secured with chains, for better
defence against the besiegers.</p>

<p id="id03019">20. Happy day:  good fortune; French, "bonheur;" both "happy
day" and "happy hour" are borrowed from the astrological
fiction about the influence of the time of birth.</p>

<p id="id03020">21. Horn, and nerve, and rind: The various layers or materials
of the shield — called boagrion in the Iliad — which was made
from the hide of the wild bull.</p>

<p id="id03021">22. His brother:  Hector.</p>

<p id="id03022">23. Who gives me drink?: Who has given me a love-potion, to
charm my heart thus away?</p>

<p id="id03023">24. That plaited she full oft in many a fold: She deliberated
carefully, with many arguments this way and that.</p>

<p id="id03024">25. Through which I mighte stand in worse plight: in a worse
position in the city; since she might through his anger lose the
protection of his brother Hector.</p>

<p id="id03025">26. I am not religious: I am not in holy vows. See the complaint
of the nuns in "The Court of Love."</p>

<p id="id03026">27. The line recalls Milton's "dark with excessive bright."</p>

<p id="id03027">28. No weal is worth, that may no sorrow drien: the meaning is,
that whosoever cannot endure sorrow deserves not happiness.</p>

<p id="id03028">29. French, "verre;" glass.</p>

<p id="id03029">30. From cast of stones ware him in the werre: let him beware
of casting stones in battle. The proverb in its modern form
warns those who live in glass houses of the folly of throwing
stones.</p>

<p id="id03030">31. Westren:  to west or wester — to decline towards the west;
so Milton speaks of the morning star as sloping towards
heaven's descent "his westering wheel."</p>

<p id="id03031">32. A pike with ass's feet etc.: this is merely another version of
the well-known example of incongruity that opens the "Ars
Poetica" of Horace.</p>

<p id="id03032">33. Tristre: tryst; a preconcerted spot to which the beaters
drove the game, and at which the sportsmen waited with their
bows.</p>

<p id="id03033">34. A kankerdort: a condition or fit of perplexed anxiety;
probably connected with the word "kink" meaning in sea phrase
a twist in an rope — and, as a verb, to twist or entangle.</p>

<p id="id03034">35. They feel in times, with vapour etern: they feel in their
seasons, by the emission of an eternal breath or inspiration (that
God loves, &amp;c.)</p>

<p id="id03035">36. The idea of this stanza is the same with that developed in
the speech of Theseus at the close of The Knight's Tale; and it is
probably derived from the lines of Boethius, quoted in note 91
to that Tale.</p>

<p id="id03036">37. In this and the following lines reappears the noble doctrine
of the exalting and purifying influence of true love, advanced in
"The Court of Love," "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale," &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id03037">38. Weir: a trap or enclosed place in a stream, for catching fish.
See note 10 to The Assembly of Fowls.</p>

<p id="id03038">39. Nor might one word for shame to it say: nor could he
answer one word for shame (at the stratagem that brought
Cressida to implore his protection)</p>

<p id="id03039">40. "All n'ere he malapert, nor made avow
     Nor was so bold to sing a foole's mass;"
i.e. although he was not over-forward and made no confession
(of his love), or was so bold as to be rash and ill-advised in his
declarations of love and worship.</p>

<p id="id03040">41. Pandarus wept as if he would turn to water; so, in The
Squire's Tale, did Canace weep for the woes of the falcon.</p>

<p id="id03041">42. If I breake your defence: if I transgress in whatever you may
forbid; French, "defendre," to prohibit.</p>

<p id="id03042">43. These lines and the succeeding stanza are addressed to
Pandarus, who had interposed some words of incitement to
Cressida.</p>

<p id="id03043">44.  In "The Court of Love," the poet says of Avaunter, that
"his ancestry of kin was to Lier; and the stanza in which that
line occurs  expresses precisely the same idea as in the text.
Vain boasters  of ladies' favours are also satirised in "The House
of Fame".</p>

<p id="id03044">45. Nice:  silly, stupid; French, "niais."</p>

<p id="id03045">46."Reheating" is read by preference for "richesse," which
stands in the older printed editions; though "richesse" certainly
better represents the word used in the original of Boccaccio —
"dovizia," meaning abundance or wealth.</p>

<p id="id03046">47. "Depart it so, for widewhere is wist
     How that there is diversity requer'd
     Betwixte thinges like, as I have lear'd:"
i.e. make this distinction, for it is universally known that there is
a great difference between things that seem the same, as I have
learned.</p>

<p id="id03047">48. Frepe: the set, or company; French, "frappe," a stamp (on
coins), a set (of moulds).</p>

<p id="id03048">49. To be "in the wind" of noisy magpies, or other birds that
might spoil sport by alarming the game, was not less desirable
than to be on the "lee-side" of the game itself, that the hunter's
presence might not be betrayed by the scent. "In the wind of,"
thus signifies not to windward of, but to leeward of — that is, in
the wind that comes from the object of pursuit.</p>

<p id="id03049">50. Bothe fremd and tame: both foes and friends — literally,
both wild and tame, the sporting metaphor being sustained.</p>

<p id="id03050">51. The lovers are supposed to say, that nothing is wanting but
to know the time at which they should meet.</p>

<p id="id03051">52. A  tale of Wade: see note 5 to the Merchant's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03052">53. Saturn, and Jove, in Cancer joined were: a conjunction that
imported rain.</p>

<p id="id03053">54. Smoky rain: An admirably graphic description of dense rain.</p>

<p id="id03054">55. For the force of "cold," see note 22 to the Nun's Priest's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id03055">56. Goddes seven:  The divinities who gave their names to the
seven planets, which, in association with the seven metals, are
mentioned in The Canon's Yeoman's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03056">57. Assayed:  experienced, tasted. See note 6 to the Squire's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id03057">58. Now is it better than both two were lorn: better this happy
issue, than that both two should be lost (through the sorrow of
fruitless love).</p>

<p id="id03058">59. Made him such feast: French, "lui fit fete" — made holiday
for him.</p>

<p id="id03059">60. The cock is called, in "The Assembly of Fowls," "the
horologe of thorpes lite;" [the clock of little villages] and in The
Nun's Priest's Tale Chanticleer knew by nature each ascension
of the equinoctial, and, when the sun had ascended fifteen
degrees, "then crew he, that it might not be amended." Here he
is termed the "common astrologer," as employing for the public
advantage his knowledge of astronomy.</p>

<p id="id03060">61. Fortuna Major: the planet Jupiter.</p>

<p id="id03061">62. When Jupiter visited Alcmena in the form of her husband
Amphitryon, he is said to have prolonged the night to the length
of three natural nights. Hercules was the fruit of the union.</p>

<p id="id03062">63. Chaucer seems to confound Titan, the title of the sun, with
Tithonus (or Tithon, as contracted in poetry), whose couch
Aurora was wont to share.</p>

<p id="id03063">64. So, in "Locksley Hall," Tennyson says that "a sorrow's
crown of sorrow is rememb'ring better things." The original is in
Dante's words:- -
"Nessun maggior dolore
 Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
 Nella miseria." — "Inferno," v. 121.
("There is no greater sorrow than to remember happy times
when in misery")</p>

<p id="id03064">65. As great a craft is to keep weal as win: it needs as much
skill to keep prosperity as to attain it.</p>

<p id="id03065">66. To heap: together. See the reference to Boethius in note 91
to the Knight's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03066">67. The smalle beastes let he go beside: a charming touch,
indicative of the noble and generous inspiration of his love.</p>

<p id="id03067">68. Mew: the cage or chamber in which hawks were kept and
carefully tended during the moulting season.</p>

<p id="id03068">69. Love of steel:  love as true as steel.</p>

<p id="id03069">70. Pandarus, as it repeatedly appears, was an unsucsessful
lover.</p>

<p id="id03070">71. "Each for his virtue holden is full dear,
     Both heroner, and falcon for rivere":—
That is, each is esteemed for a special virtue or faculty, as the
large gerfalcon for the chase of heron, the smaller goshawk for
the chase of river fowl.</p>

<p id="id03071">72. Zausis: An author of whom no record survives.</p>

<p id="id03072">73. And upon new case lieth new advice:  new counsels must be
adopted as new circumstances arise.</p>

<p id="id03073">74. Hid in mew: hidden in a place remote from the world — of
which Pandarus thus betrays ignorance.</p>

<p id="id03074">75. The modern phrase "sixes and sevens," means "in
confusion:" but here the idea of gaming perhaps suits the sense
better — "set the world upon a cast of the dice."</p>

<p id="id03075">76. The controversy between those who maintained the doctrine
of predestination and those who held that of free-will raged
with no less animation at Chaucer's day, and before it, than it
has done in the subsequent five centuries; the Dominicans
upholding the sterner creed, the Franciscans taking the other
side. Chaucer has more briefly, and with the same care not to
commit himself, referred to the discussion in The Nun's Priest's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id03076">77. That have their top full high and smooth y-shore: that are
eminent among the clergy, who wear the tonsure.</p>

<p id="id03077">78. Athamante: Athamas, son of Aeolus; who, seized with
madness, under the wrath of Juno for his neglect of his wife
Nephele, slew his son Learchus.</p>

<p id="id03078">79. Simois:  one of the rivers of the Troad, flowing into the
Xanthus.</p>

<p id="id03079">80. Troilus was the son of Priam and Hecuba.</p>

<p id="id03080">81. The son of Tydeus:  Diomedes; far oftener called Tydides,
after his father Tydeus, king of Argos.</p>

<p id="id03081">82. Couthe more than the creed:  knew more than the mere
elements (of the science of Love).</p>

<p id="id03082">83. Arache: wrench away, unroot (French, "arracher"); the
opposite of "enrace," to root in, implant.</p>

<p id="id03083">84. It will be remembered that, at the beginning of the first
book, Cressida is introduced to us as a widow.</p>

<p id="id03084">85. Diomede is called "sudden," for the unexpectedness of his
assault on Cressida's heart — or, perhaps, for the abrupt
abandonment of his indifference to love.</p>

<p id="id03085">86. Penscel:  a pennon or pendant; French, "penoncel." It  was
the custom in chivalric times for a knight to wear, on days of
tournament or in battle, some such token of his lady's favour, or
badge of his service to her.</p>

<p id="id03086">87. She has been told that Troilus is deceiving her.</p>

<p id="id03087">88. The Roman kalends were the first day of the month, when a
change of weather was usually expected.</p>

<p id="id03088">89. Maker, and making, words used in the Middle Ages to
signify the composer and the composition of poetry, correspond
exactly with the Greek "poietes" and "poiema," from "poieo," I
make.</p>

<p id="id03089">90. My rather speech:  my earlier, former subject; "rather" is the
cormparative of the old adjective "rath," early.</p>

<p id="id03090">91. Up to the hollowness of the seventh sphere: passing up
through the hollowness or concavity of the spheres, which all
revolve round each other and are all contained by God (see note
5 to the Assembly of Fowls), the soul of Troilus, looking
downward, beholds the converse or convex side of the spheres
which it has traversed.</p>

<p id="id03091">92. Sorted: allotted; from Latin, "sors," lot, fortune.</p>

<p id="id03092">93. Rascaille: rabble; French, "racaille" — a mob or multitude,
the riff-raff; so Spencer speaks of the "rascal routs" of inferior
combatants.</p>

<p id="id03093">94. John Gower, the poet, a contemporary and friend of
Chaucer's; author, among other works, of the "Confessio
Amantis." See note 1 to the Man of Law's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03094">95. Strode was an eminent scholar of Merton College, Oxford,
and tutor to Chaucer's son Lewis.</p>

<p id="id03095">96. Explicit Liber Troili et Cresseidis: "The end of the book of
Troilus and Cressida."</p>

<h3 id="id03096" style="margin-top: 3em">CHAUCER'S DREAM.</h3>

<p id="id03097" style="margin-top: 2em">[This pretty allegory, or rather conceit, containing one or two
passages that for vividness and for delicacy yield to nothing in
the whole range of Chaucer's poetry, had never been printed
before the year 1597, when it was included in the edition of
Speght. Before that date, indeed, a Dream of Chaucer had been
printed; but the poem so described was in reality "The Book of
the Duchess; or the Death of Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster" —
which is not included in the present edition. Speght says that
"This Dream, devised by Chaucer, seemeth to be a covert report
of the marriage of John of Gaunt, the King's son, with Blanche,
the daughter of Henry, Duke of Lancaster; who after long love
(during the time whereof the poet feigneth them to be dead)
were in the end, by consent of friends, happily married; figured
by a bird bringing in his bill an herb, which restored them to life
again. Here also is showed Chaucer's match with a certain
gentlewoman, who, although she was a stranger, was,
notwithstanding, so well liked and loved of the Lady Blanche
and her Lord, as Chaucer himself also was, that gladly they
concluded a marriage between them." John of Gaunt, at the age
of nineteen, and while yet Earl of Richmond, was married to the
Lady Blanche at Reading in May 1359; Chaucer, then a prisoner
in France, probably did not return to England till peace was
concluded in the following year; so that his marriage to Philippa
Roet, the sister of the Duchess Blanche's favourite attendant
Katharine Roet, could not have taken place till some time after
that of the Duke. In the poem, it is represented to have
immediately followed; but no consequence need be attached to
that statement. Enough that it followed at no great interval of
time; and that the intimate relations which Chaucer had already
begun to form with John of Gaunt, might well warrant him in
writing this poem on the occasion of the Duke's marriage, and
in weaving his own love-fortunes with those of the principal
figures. In the necessary abridgement of the poem for the
present edition, the subsidiary branch of the allegory, relating to
the poet's own love affair, has been so far as possible separated
from the main branch, which shadows forth the fortunes of John
and Blanche. The poem, in full, contains, with an "Envoy"
arbitrarily appended, 2233 lines; of which 510 are given here.]

<p id="id03098" style="margin-top: 2em">WHEN Flora, the queen of pleasance,<br>

Had wholly *achiev'd the obeisance*                  *won the obedience*<br>

Of the fresh and the new season,<br>

Thorough ev'ry region;<br>

And with her mantle *whole covert*                      *wholly covered*<br>

What winter had *made discovert,* —                          *stripped*<br>
</p>

<p id="id03099">On a May night, the poet lay alone, thinking of his lady, and all
her beauty; and, falling asleep, he dreamed that he was in an
island</p>

<p id="id03100">Where wall, and gate, was all of glass,<br>

And so was closed round about,<br>

That leaveless* none came in nor out;                *without permission<br>

Uncouth and strange to behold;<br>

For ev'ry gate, of fine gold,<br>

A thousand fanes,* ay turning,                      *vanes, weathercocks<br>

Entuned* had, and birds singing                 *contrived so as to emit<br>

Diversely, on each fane a pair,                          a musical sound<br>

With open mouth, against the air; &lt;1&gt;<br>

And *of a suit* were all the tow'rs,                  *of the same plan*<br>

Subtilly *carven aft* flow'rs                      *carved to represent*<br>

Of uncouth colours, *during ay,*                       *lasting forever*<br>

That never be none seen in May,<br>

With many a small turret high;<br>

But man alive I could not sigh,*                                    *see<br>

Nor creatures, save ladies play,*                 *disporting themselves<br>

Which were such of their array,<br>

That, as me thought, *of goodlihead*                    *for comeliness*<br>

They passed all, and womanhead.<br>

For to behold them dance and sing,<br>

It seemed like none earthly thing;<br>
</p>

<p id="id03101">And all were of the same age, save one; who was advanced in
years, though no less gay in demeanour than the rest. While he
stood admiring the richness and beauty of the place, and the
fairness of the ladies, which had the notable gift of enduring
unimpaired till death, the poet was accosted by the old lady, to
whom he had to yield himself prisoner; because the ordinance of
the isle was, that no man should dwell there; and the ladies' fear
of breaking the law was enhanced by the temporary absence of
their queen from the realm. Just at this moment the cry was
raised that the queen came; all the ladies hastened to meet her;
and soon the poet saw her approach — but in her company his
mistress, wearing the same garb, and a seemly knight. All the
ladies wondered greatly at this; and the queen explained:</p>

<p id="id03102">"My sisters, how it hath befall,*                              *befallen<br>

I trow ye know it one and all,<br>

That of long time here have I been<br>

Within this isle biding as queen,<br>

Living at ease, that never wight<br>

More perfect joye have not might;<br>

And to you been of governance<br>

Such as you found in whole pleasance, &lt;2&gt;<br>

In every thing as ye know,<br>

After our custom and our law;<br>

Which how they firste founded were,<br>

I trow ye wot all the mannere.<br>

And who the queen is of this isle, —<br>

As I have been this longe while, —<br>

Each seven years must, of usage,<br>

Visit the heav'nly hermitage,<br>

Which on a rock so highe stands,<br>

In a strange sea, out from all lands,<br>

That for to make the pilgrimage<br>

Is call'd a perilous voyage;<br>

For if the wind be not good friend,<br>

The journey dureth to the end<br>

Of him which that it undertakes;<br>

Of twenty thousand not one scapes.<br>

Upon which rock groweth a tree,<br>

That certain years bears apples three;<br>

Which three apples whoso may have,<br>

Is *from all displeasance y-save*                   *safe from all pain*<br>

That in the seven years may fall;<br>

This wot you well, both one and all.<br>

For the first apple and the hext,*                          *highest &lt;3&gt;<br>

Which groweth unto you the next,<br>

Hath three virtues notable,<br>

And keepeth youth ay durable,<br>

Beauty, and looks, ever-in-one,*                            *continually<br>

The second apple, red and green,<br>

Only with lookes of your eyne,<br>

You nourishes in great pleasance,<br>

Better than partridge or fesaunce,*                            *pheasant<br>

And feedeth ev'ry living wight<br>

Pleasantly, only with the sight.<br>

And the third apple of the three,<br>

Which groweth lowest on the tree,<br>

Whoso it beareth may not fail*                     *miss, fail to obtain<br>

Or thing that to you was noyance.*                      *offence, injury<br>

So that you have as goddesses<br>

Lived above all princesses.<br>

Now is befall'n, as ye may see;<br>

To gather these said apples three,<br>

I have not fail'd, against the day,<br>

Thitherward to take the way,<br>

*Weening to speed* as I had oft.                  *expecting to succeed*<br>

But when I came, I found aloft<br>

My sister, which that hero stands,<br>

Having those apples in her hands,<br>

Advising* them, and nothing said,                  *regarding, gazing on<br>

But look'd as she were *well apaid:*                         *satisfied*<br>

And as I stood her to behold,<br>

Thinking how my joys were cold,<br>

Since I these apples *have not might,*                  *might not have*<br>

Even with that so came this knight,<br>

And in his arms, of me unware,<br>

Me took, and to his ship me bare,<br>

And said, though him I ne'er had seen,<br>

Yet had I long his lady been;<br>

Wherefore I shoulde with him wend,<br>

And he would, to his life's end,<br>

My servant be; and gan to sing,<br>

As one that had won a rich thing.<br>

Then were my spirits from me gone,<br>

So suddenly every one,<br>

That in me appear'd but death,<br>

For I felt neither life nor breath,<br>

Nor good nor harme none I knew,<br>

The sudden pain me was so new,<br>

That *had not the hasty grace be*               *had it not been for the<br>

Of this lady, that from the tree                        prompt kindness*<br>

Of her gentleness so bled,*                                    *hastened<br>

Me to comforten, I had died;<br>

And of her three apples she one<br>

Into mine hand there put anon,<br>

Which brought again my mind and breath,<br>

And me recover'd from the death.<br>

Wherefore to her so am I hold,*                       *beholden, obliged<br>

That for her all things do I wo'ld,<br>

For she was leach* of all my smart,                           *physician<br>

And from great pain so quit* my heart.                        *delivered<br>

And as God wot, right as ye hear,<br>

Me to comfort with friendly cheer,<br>

She did her prowess and her might.<br>

And truly eke so did this knight,<br>

In that he could; and often said,<br>

That of my woe he was *ill paid,*              *distressed, ill-pleased*<br>

And curs'd the ship that him there brought,<br>

The mast, the master that it wrought.<br>

And, as each thing must have an end,<br>

My sister here, our bother friend, &lt;4&gt;<br>

Gan with her words so womanly<br>

This knight entreat, and cunningly,<br>

For mine honour and hers also,<br>

And said that with her we should go<br>

Both in her ship, where she was brought,<br>

Which was so wonderfully wrought,<br>

So clean, so rich, and so array'd,<br>

That we were both content and paid;*                          *satisfied<br>

And me to comfort and to please,<br>

And my heart for to put at ease,<br>

She took great pain in little while,<br>

And thus hath brought us to this isle<br>

As ye may see; wherefore each one<br>

I pray you thank her one and one,<br>

As heartily as ye can devise,<br>

Or imagine in any wise."<br>
</p>

<p id="id03103">At once there then men mighte see'n,<br>

A world of ladies fall on kneen<br>

Before my lady, —<br>
</p>

<p id="id03104">Thanking her, and placing themselves at her commandment.
Then the queen sent the aged lady to the knight, to learn of him
why he had done her all this woe; and when the messenger had
discharged her mission, telling the knight that in the general
opinion he had done amiss, he fell down suddenly as if dead for
sorrow and repentance. Only with great difficulty, by the queen
herself, was he restored to consciousness and comfort; but
though she spoke kind and hope-inspiring words, her heart was
not in her speech,</p>

<p id="id03105">For her intent was, to his barge<br>

Him for to bring against the eve,<br>

With certain ladies, and take leave,<br>

And pray him, of his gentleness,<br>

To *suffer her* thenceforth in peace,                    *let her dwell*<br>

As other princes had before;<br>

And from thenceforth, for evermore,<br>

She would him worship in all wise<br>

That gentlenesse might devise;<br>

And *pain her* wholly to fulfil,               *make her utmost efforts*<br>

In honour, his pleasure and will.<br>
</p>

<p id="id03106">And during thus this knighte's woe, —<br>

Present* the queen and other mo',                *(there being) present*<br>

My lady and many another wight, —<br>

Ten thousand shippes at a sight<br>

I saw come o'er the wavy flood,<br>

With sail and oar; that, as I stood<br>

Them to behold, I gan marvail<br>

From whom might come so many a sail;<br>

For, since the time that I was born,<br>

Such a navy therebeforn<br>

Had I not seen, nor so array'd,<br>

That for the sight my hearte play'd<br>

Ay to and fro within my breast;<br>

For joy long was ere it would rest.<br>

For there were sailes *full of flow'rs;*      *embroidered with flowers*<br>

After, castles with huge tow'rs, &lt;5&gt;<br>

Seeming full of armes bright,<br>

That wond'rous lusty* was the sight;                           *pleasant<br>

With large tops, and mastes long,<br>

Richly depaint' and *rear'd among.*                  *raised among them*<br>

At certain times gan repair<br>

Smalle birdes down from the air,<br>

And on the shippes' bounds* about                              *bulwarks<br>

Sat and sang, with voice full out,<br>

Ballads and lays right joyously,<br>

As they could in their harmony.<br>
</p>

<p id="id03107">The ladies were alarmed and sorrow-stricken at sight of the
ships, thinking that the knight's companions were on board; and
they went towards the walls of the isle, to shut the gates. But it
was Cupid who came; and he had already landed, and marched
straight to the place where the knight lay. Then he chid the
queen for her unkindness to his servant; shot an arrow into her
heart; and passed through the crowd, until he found the poet's
lady, whom he saluted and complimented, urging her to have
pity on him that loved her. While the poet, standing apart, was
revolving all this in his mind, and resolving truly to serve his
lady, he saw the queen advance to Cupid, with a petition in
which she besought forgiveness of past offences, and promised
continual and zealous service till her death. Cupid smiled, and
said that he would be king within that island, his new conquest;
then, after long conference with the queen, he called a council
for the morrow, of all who chose to wear his colours. In the
morning, such was the press of ladies, that scarcely could
standing-room be found in all the plain. Cupid presided; and one
of his counsellors addressed the mighty crowd, promising that
ere his departure his lord should bring to an agreement all the
parties there present. Then Cupid gave to the knight and the
dreamer each his lady; promised his favour to all the others in
that place who would truly and busily serve in love; and at
evening took his departure. Next morning, having declined the
proffered sovereignty of the island, the poet's mistress also
embarked, leaving him behind; but he dashed through the
waves, was drawn on board her ship from peril of death, and
graciously received into his lady's lasting favour. Here the poet
awakes, finding his cheeks and body all wet with tears; and,
removing into another chamber, to rest more in peace, he falls
asleep anew, and continues the dream. Again he is within the
island, where the knight and all the ladies are assembled on a
green, and it is resolved by the assembly, not only that the
knight shall be their king, but that every lady there shall be
wedded also. It is determined that the knight shall depart that
very day, and return, within ten days, with such a host of
Benedicts, that none in the isle need lack husbands. The knight</p>

<p id="id03108">Anon into a little barge<br>

Brought was, late against an eve,<br>

Where of all he took his leave.<br>

Which barge was, as a man thought,<br>

Aft* his pleasure to him brought;                         *according to*<br>

The queen herself accustom'd ay<br>

In the same barge to play.*                              *take her sport<br>

It needed neither mast nor rother*                               *rudder<br>

(I have not heard of such another),<br>

Nor master for the governance;*                                *steering<br>

Withoute labour, east and west;<br>

All was one, calm or tempest. &lt;6&gt;<br>

And I went with, at his request,<br>

And was the first pray'd to the feast.*                *the bridal feast<br>

When he came unto his country,<br>

And passed had the wavy sea,<br>

In a haven deep and large<br>

He left his rich and noble barge,<br>

And to the court, shortly to tell,<br>

He went, where he was wont to dwell, —<br>
</p>

<p id="id03109">And was gladly received as king by the estates of the land; for
during his absence his father, "old, and wise, and hoar," had
died, commending to their fidelity his absent son. The prince
related to the estates his journey, and his success in finding the
princess in quest of whom he had gone seven years before; and
said that he must have sixty thousand guests at his marriage
feast. The lords gladly guaranteed the number within the set
time; but afterwards they found that fifteen days must be spent
in the necessary preparations. Between shame and sorrow, the
prince, thus compelled to break his faith, took to his bed, and,
in wailing and self-reproach,</p>

<p id="id03110">— Endur'd the days fifteen,<br>

Till that the lords, on an evene,*                              *evening<br>

How and what wise they had *purvey'd                  *provided suitably<br>

As all were lodged in a town.<br>

Forth went the ship, said was the creed;&lt;9&gt;<br>

And on their knees, *for their good speed,*        *to pray for success*<br>

Down kneeled ev'ry wight a while,<br>

To keep the day it might not be'n,<br>

That he appointed with the queen.<br>
</p>

<p id="id03112">Wherefore the prince slept neither day nor night, till he and his
people landed on the glass-walled isle, "weening to be in heav'n
that night." But ere they had gone a little way, they met a lady
all in black, with piteous countenance, who reproached the
prince for his untruth, and informed him that, unable to bear the
reproach to their name, caused by the lightness of their trust in
strangers, the queen and all the ladies of the isle had vowed
neither to eat, nor drink, nor sleep, nor speak, nor cease
weeping till all were dead. The queen had died the first; and half
of the other ladies had already "under the earth ta'en lodging
new." The woeful recorder of all these woes invites the prince
to behold the queen's hearse:</p>

<p id="id03113">"Come within, come see her hearse<br>

Where ye shall see the piteous sight<br>

That ever yet was shown to knight;<br>

For ye shall see ladies stand,<br>

Each with a greate rod in hand,<br>

Clad in black, with visage white,<br>

Ready each other for to smite,<br>

If any be that will not weep;<br>

Or who makes countenance to sleep.<br>

They be so beat, that all so blue<br>

They be as cloth that dy'd is new."<br>
</p>

<p id="id03114">Scarcely has the lady ceased to speak, when the prince plucks
forth a dagger, plunges it into his heart, and, drawing but one
breath, expires.</p>

<p id="id03115">For whiche cause the lusty host,<br>

Which [stood] in battle on the coast,<br>

At once for sorrow such a cry<br>

Such, that of ladies soon a rout*                        *company, crowd<br>

<p id="id03120">On the morrow a general assembly was convoked, and it was
resolved that the wedding feast should be celebrated within the
island. Messengers were sent to strange realms, to invite kings,
queens, duchesses, and princesses; and a special embassy was
despatched, in the magic barge, to seek the poet's mistress —
who was brought back after fourteen days, to the great joy of
the queen. Next day took place the wedding of the prince and
all the knights to the queen and all the ladies; and a three
months' feast followed, on a large plain "under a wood, in a
champaign, betwixt a river and a well, where never had abbey
nor cell been, nor church, house, nor village, in time of any
manne's age." On the day after the general wedding, all
entreated the poet's lady to consent to crown his love with
marriage; she yielded; the bridal was splendidly celebrated; and
to the sound of marvellous music the poet awoke, to find
neither lady nor creature — but only old portraitures on the
tapestry, of horsemen, hawks, and hounds, and hurt deer full of
wounds. Great was his grief that he had lost all the bliss of his
dream; and he concludes by praying his lady so to accept his
love-service, that the dream may turn to reality.</p>

<p id="id03121">Or elles, without more I pray,<br>

That this night, ere it be day,<br>

Aboute the Isle of Pleasance,<br>

*Under my lady's obeisance,*                        *subject to my lady*<br>

In her service, and in such wise,<br>

As it may please her to devise;<br>

has no apparent applicability; and perhaps the better reading is
"our bother friend" — that is, the lady who has proved herself a

Troilus' soliloquy on the impending loss of his mistress, is made,
addressing Troilus and Cressida, to speaks of "your bother," or

<h3 id="id03137" style="margin-top: 3em">THE PROLOGUE TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN.</h3>

<p id="id03138" style="margin-top: 2em">[SOME difference of opinion exists as to the date at
which Chaucer wrote "The Legend of Good
Women." Those who would fix that date at a
period not long before the poet's death — who
would place the poem, indeed, among his closing
labours — support their opinion by the fact that the
Prologue recites most of Chaucer's principal
works, and glances, besides, at a long array of
other productions, too many to be fully catalogued.
But, on the other hand, it is objected that the
"Legend" makes no mention of "The Canterbury
Tales" as such; while two of those Tales — the
Knight's and the Second Nun's — are enumerated
by the titles which they bore as separate
compositions, before they were incorporated in the
great collection: "The Love of Palamon and
Arcite," and "The Life of Saint Cecile" (see note 1
to the Second Nun's tale). Tyrwhitt seems perfectly
justified in placing the composition of the poem
immediately before that of Chaucer's magnum
opus, and after the marriage of Richard II to his
first queen, Anne of Bohemia. That event took
place in 1382; and since it is to Anne that the poet
refers when he makes Alcestis bid him give his
poem to the queen "at Eltham or at Sheen," the
"Legend" could not have been written earlier. The
old editions tell us that "several ladies in the Court
took offence at Chaucer's large speeches against
the untruth of women; therefore the queen enjoin'd
him to compile this book in the commendation of
sundry maidens and wives, who show'd themselves
faithful to faithless men. This seems to have been
written after The Flower and the Leaf." Evidently it
was, for distinct references to that poem are to be
found in the Prologue; but more interesting is the
indication which it furnishes, that "Troilus and
Cressida" was the work, not of the poet's youth,
but of his maturer age. We could hardly expect the
queen — whether of Love or of England — to
demand seriously from Chaucer a retractation of
sentiments which he had expressed a full
generation before, and for which he had made
atonement by the splendid praises of true love sung
in "The Court of Love," "The Cuckoo and the
Nightingale," and other poems of youth and middle
life. But "Troilus and Cressida" is coupled with
"The Romance of the Rose," as one of the poems
which had given offence to the servants and the
God of Love; therefore we may suppose it to have
more prominently engaged courtly notice at a later
period of the poet's life, than even its undoubted
popularity could explain. At whatever date, or in
whatever circumstances, undertaken, "The Legend
of Good Women" is a fragment. There are several
signs that it was designed to contain the stories of
twenty-five ladies, although the number of the
good women is in the poem itself set down at
nineteen; but nine legends only were actually
composed, or have come down to us. They are,
those of Cleopatra Queen of Egypt (126 lines),
Thisbe of Babylon (218), Dido Queen of Carthage
(442), Hypsipyle and Medea (312), Lucrece of
Rome (206), Ariadne of Athens (340), Phiomela
(167), Phyllis (168), and Hypermnestra (162).
Prefixed to these stories, which are translated or
imitated from Ovid, is a Prologue containing 579
lines — the only part of the "Legend" given in the
present edition. It is by far the most original, the
strongest, and most pleasing part of the poem; the
description of spring, and of his enjoyment of that
season, are in Chaucer's best manner; and the
political philosophy by which Alcestis mitigates the
wrath of Cupid, adds another to the abounding
proofs that, for his knowledge of the world,
Chaucer fairly merits the epithet of "many-sided"
which Shakespeare has won by his knowledge of
man.]</p>

Of it, to do it alle reverence,<br>

As she that is of alle flowers flow'r,<br>

Fulfilled of all virtue and honour,<br>

And ever alike fair, and fresh of hue;<br>

As well in winter, as in summer new,<br>

This love I ever, and shall until I die;<br>

All* swear I not, of this I will not lie,                      *although<br>

There loved no wight hotter in his life.<br>

And when that it is eve, I runne blife,*               *quickly, eagerly<br>

As soon as ever the sun begins to west,*               *decline westward<br>

To see this flow'r, how it will go to rest,<br>

For fear of night, so hateth she darkness!<br>

Her cheer* is plainly spread in the brightness              *countenance<br>

Of the sunne, for there it will unclose.<br>

Alas! that I had English, rhyme or prose,<br>

Sufficient this flow'r to praise aright!<br>

But help me, ye that have *cunning or might;*           *skill or power*<br>

Ye lovers, that can make of sentiment,<br>

In this case ought ye to be diligent<br>

To further me somewhat in my labour,<br>

Whether ye be with the Leaf or the Flow'r; &lt;3&gt;<br>

For well I wot, that ye have herebefore<br>

Of making ropen,* and led away the corn; &lt;4&gt;                     *reaped<br>

And I come after, gleaning here and there,<br>

And am full glad if I may find an ear<br>

Of any goodly word that you have left.<br>

And though it hap me to rehearsen eft*                            *again<br>

What ye have in your freshe songes said,<br>

Forbeare me, and be not *evil apaid,*                       *displeased*<br>

Since that ye see I do it in th'honour<br>

Of love, and eke in service of the flow'r<br>

Whom that I serve as I have wit or might. &lt;5&gt;<br>

She is the clearness, and the very* light,                         *true<br>

That in this darke world me winds* and leads;             *turns, guides<br>

The heart within my sorrowful breast you dreads,<br>

And loves so sore, that ye be, verily,<br>

The mistress of my wit, and nothing I.<br>

My word, my works, are knit so in your bond,<br>

That, as a harp obeyeth to the hand,<br>

That makes it sound after his fingering,<br>

Right so may ye out of my hearte bring<br>

Such voice, right as you list, to laugh or plain;*      *complain, mourn<br>

Be ye my guide, and lady sovereign.<br>

As to mine earthly god, to you I call,<br>

Both in this work, and in my sorrows all.<br>

<p id="id03142">But wherefore that I spake to give credence<br>

To old stories, and do them reverence,<br>

And that men muste more things believe<br>

Than they may see at eye, or elles preve,*                        *prove<br>

That shall I say, when that I see my time;<br>

I may not all at ones speak in rhyme.<br>

My busy ghost,* that thirsteth always new                        *spirit<br>

To see this flow'r so young, so fresh of hue,<br>

Constrained me with so greedy desire,<br>

That in my heart I feele yet the fire,<br>

That made me to rise ere it were day, —<br>

And this was now the first morrow of May, —<br>

With dreadful heart, and glad devotion,<br>

For to be at the resurrection<br>

Of this flower, when that it should unclose<br>

Against the sun, that rose as red as rose,<br>

That in the breast was of the beast* that day      *the sign of the Bull<br>

That Agenore's daughter led away. &lt;6&gt;<br>

And down on knees anon right I me set,<br>

And as I could this freshe flow'r I gret,*                      *greeted<br>

Kneeling alway, till it unclosed was,<br>

Upon the smalle, softe, sweete grass,<br>

That was with flowers sweet embroider'd all,<br>

Of such sweetness and such odour *o'er all,*                *everywhere*<br>

That, for to speak of gum, or herb, or tree,<br>

Comparison may none y-maked be;<br>

For it surmounteth plainly all odours,<br>

And for rich beauty the most gay of flow'rs.<br>

Forgotten had the earth his poor estate<br>

Of winter, that him naked made and mate,*            *dejected, lifeless<br>

And with his sword of cold so sore grieved;<br>

Now hath th'attemper* sun all that releaved**     *temperate **furnished<br>

That naked was, and clad it new again.                  anew with leaves<br>

The smalle fowles, of the season fain,*                            *glad<br>

That of the panter* and the net be scap'd,                     *draw-net<br>

Upon the fowler, that them made awhap'd*          *terrified, confounded<br>

In winter, and destroyed had their brood,<br>

In his despite them thought it did them good<br>

To sing of him, and in their song despise<br>

The foule churl, that, for his covetise,*                         *greed<br>

Had them betrayed with his sophistry*                        *deceptions<br>

This was their song: "The fowler we defy,<br>

And all his craft:" and some sunge clear<br>

Layes of love, that joy it was to hear,<br>

In worshipping* and praising of their make;**          *honouring **mate<br>

And for the blissful newe summer's sake,<br>

Upon the branches full of blossoms soft,<br>

In their delight they turned them full oft,<br>

And sunge, "Blessed be Saint Valentine! &lt;7&gt;<br>

For on his day I chose you to be mine,<br>

Withoute repenting, my hearte sweet."<br>

And therewithal their heals began to meet,<br>

Yielding honour, and humble obeisances,<br>

To love, and did their other observances<br>

That longen unto Love and to Nature;<br>

Construe that as you list, I *do no cure.*                *care nothing*<br>

And those that hadde *done unkindeness,*              *committed offence<br>

As doth the tidife, &lt;8&gt; for newfangleness,         against natural laws*<br>

Besoughte mercy for their trespassing<br>

And humblely sange their repenting,<br>

And swore upon the blossoms to be true;<br>

So that their mates would upon them rue,*                     *take pity<br>

And at the laste made their accord.*                     *reconciliation<br>

All* found they Danger** for a time a lord,          *although **disdain<br>

Yet Pity, through her stronge gentle might,<br>

Forgave, and made mercy pass aright<br>

Through Innocence, and ruled Courtesy.<br>

But I ne call not innocence folly<br>

Nor false pity, for virtue is the mean,<br>

As Ethic &lt;9&gt; saith, in such manner I mean.<br>

And thus these fowles, void of all malice,<br>

Accorded unto Love, and lefte vice<br>

Of hate, and sangen all of one accord,<br>

"Welcome, Summer, our governor and lord!"<br>

And Zephyrus and Flora gentilly<br>

Gave to the flowers, soft and tenderly,<br>

Their sweete breath, and made them for to spread,<br>

As god and goddess of the flow'ry mead;<br>

In which me thought I mighte, day by day,<br>

Dwellen alway, the jolly month of May,<br>

Withoute sleep, withoute meat or drink.<br>

Adown full softly I began to sink,<br>

And, leaning on mine elbow and my side<br>

The longe day I shope* to abide,                     *resolved, prepared<br>

For nothing elles, and I shall not lie<br>

That men by reason well it calle may<br>

The Daye's-eye, or else the Eye of Day,<br>

The empress and the flow'r of flowers all<br>

I pray to God that faire may she fall!<br>

And all that love flowers, for her sake:<br>

But, nathelesse, *ween not that I make*             *do not fancy that I<br>

In praising of the Flow'r against the Leaf,             write this poem*<br>

No more than of the corn against the sheaf;<br>

*Nor I n'ot* who serves Leaf, nor who the Flow'r;        *nor do I know*<br>

Well *brooke they* their service or labour!         *may they profit by*<br>

<p id="id03143">When that the sun out of the south gan west,<br>

For of one pearle, fine, oriential,<br>

Her white crowne was y-maked all,<br>

Made her like a daisy for to see'n,*                          *look upon<br>

Consider'd eke her fret of gold above.<br>

Y-clothed was this mighty God of Love<br>

In silk embroider'd, full of greene greves,*                     *boughs<br>

In which there was a fret of red rose leaves,<br>

The freshest since the world was first begun.<br>

His gilt hair was y-crowned with a sun,<br>

lnstead of gold, for* heaviness and weight;                    *to avoid<br>

So womanly, so benign, and so meek,<br>

In creature that formed is by Kind;*                             *Nature<br>

For lo! the gentle kind of the lion;<br>

For when a fly offendeth him, or biteth,<br>

He with his tail away the flye smiteth,<br>

All easily; for of his gentery*                               *nobleness<br>

And ever have regard to his degree.<br>

For, Sir, it is no mastery for a lord<br>

To damn* a man, without answer of word;                         *condemn<br>

And for a lord, that is *full foul to use.*     *most infamous practice*<br>

And it be so he* may him not excuse,                       *the offender<br>

Yet hath he made lewed* folk delight                           *ignorant<br>

He made the book that hight the House of Fame,<br>

And the Parliament of Fowles, as I guess,<br>

And all the Love of Palamon and Arcite, &lt;25&gt;<br>

And, for to speak of other holiness,<br>

He hath in prose translated Boece, &lt;26&gt;<br>

For why? a true man, withoute dread,                           **offence<br>

Nor a true lover oughte me to blame,<br>

Though that I spoke a false lover some shame.<br>

They oughte rather with me for to hold,<br>

<p id="id03151">And she answer'd; "Let be thine arguing,<br>

Thou shalt, while that thou livest, year by year,<br>

That were true in loving all their lives;<br>

<p id="id03152">The God of Love gan smile, and then he said:<br>

"Know'st thou," quoth he, "whether this be wife or maid,<br>

Or queen, or countess, or of what degree,<br>

That hath deserved sorely for to smart?<br>

But pity runneth soon in gentle* heart; &lt;32&gt;                 *nobly born<br>

No more but that I see well she is good."<br>

"That is a true tale, by my hood,"<br>

Quoth Love; "and that thou knowest well, pardie!<br>

If it be so that thou advise* thee.                             *bethink<br>

And eke to go to hell rather than he;<br>

And Hercules rescued her, pardie!<br>

And brought her out of hell again to bliss?"<br>

And I answer'd again, and saide; "Yes,<br>

Now know I her; and is this good Alceste,<br>

The daisy, and mine own hearte's rest?<br>

Now feel I well the goodness of this wife,<br>

<p id="id03155">Thus endeth the Prologue.</p>

<p id="id03156" style="margin-top: 2em">Notes to The prologue to The Legend of Good Women</p>

<p id="id03157" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Bernard, the Monke, saw not all, pardie!: a proverbial saying,
signifying that even the wisest, or those who claim to be the
wisest, cannot know everything. Saint Bernard, who was the
last, or among the last, of the Fathers, lived in the first half of
the twelfth century.</p>

<p id="id03158">2. Compare Chaucer's account of his habits, in "The House of
Fame."</p>

<p id="id03159">3. See introductory note to "The Flower and the Leaf."</p>

<p id="id03160">4.                  "ye have herebefore
Of making ropen, and led away the corn"
The meaning is, that the "lovers" have long ago said all that can
be said, by way of poetry, or "making" on the subject. See note
89 to "Troilus and Cressida" for the etymology of "making"
meaning "writing poetry."</p>

<p id="id03161">5. The poet glides here into an address to his lady.</p>

<p id="id03162">6. Europa was the daughter of Agenores, king of Phrygia. She
was carried away to Crete by Jupiter, disguised as a lovely and
tame bull, on whose back Europa mounted as she was sporting
with her maidens by the sea-shore. The story is beautifully told
in Horace, Odes, iii. 27.</p>

<p id="id03163">7. See "The Assembly of Fowls," which was supposed to
happen on St. Valentine's day.</p>

<p id="id03164">8. The tidife:  The titmouse, or any other small bird, which
sometimes brings up the cuckoo's young when its own have
been destroyed. See note 44 to "The Assembly of Fowls."</p>

<p id="id03165">9. Ethic: the "Ethics" of Aristotle.</p>

<p id="id03166">10. "For as to me is lever none nor lother,
    I n'am withholden yet with neither n'other."
i.e For as neither is more liked or disliked by me, I am not
bound by, holden to, either the one or the other.</p>

<p id="id03167">11. All of another tun i.e. wine of another tun — a quite
different matter.</p>

<p id="id03168">12. Compare the description of the arbour in "The Flower and
the Leaf."</p>

<p id="id03169">13. Flowrons: florets; little flowers on the disk of the main
flower; French "fleuron."</p>

<p id="id03170">14. Mr Bell thinks that Chaucer here praises the complaisance
of Marcia, the wife of Cato, in complying with his will when he
made her over to his friend Hortensius. It would be in better
keeping with the spirit of the poet's praise, to believe that we
should read "Porcia Catoun" — Porcia the daughter of Cato,
who was married to Brutus, and whose perfect wifehood has
been celebrated in The Franklin's Tale. See note 25 to the
Franklin's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03171">15. Isoude: See note 21 to "The Assembly of Fowls".</p>

<p id="id03172">16. Lavine: Lavinia, the heroine of the Aeneid, who became the
wife of Aeneas.</p>

<p id="id03173">17. Polyxena, daughter of Priam, king of Troy, fell in
love with Achilles, and, when he was killed, she fled to the
Greek camp, and slew herself on the tomb of her hero-lover.</p>

<p id="id03174">18. Mountance: extent, duration. See note 84 to "The House of
Fame".</p>

<p id="id03175">19. Relic: emblem; or cherished treasure; like the relics at
the shrines of saints.</p>

<p id="id03176">20. Losengeour: deceiver. See note 31 to the Nun's Priest's
Tale.</p>

<p id="id03177">21. "Toteler" is an old form of the word "tatler," from the
Anglo-Saxon, "totaelan," to talk much, to tattle.</p>

<p id="id03178">22. Envy is lavender of the court alway: a "lavender"  is a
washerwoman or laundress; the word represents "meretrice"in
Dante's original — meaning a courtezan; but we can well
understand that Chaucer thought it prudent, and at the same
time more true to the moral state of the English Court, to
change the character assigned to Envy. He means that Envy is
perpetually at Court, like some garrulous, bitter old woman
employed there in the most servile offices, who remains at her
post through all the changes among the courtiers. The passage
cited from Dante will be found in the "Inferno," canto xiii. 64 —
69.</p>

<p id="id03179">23. Chaucer says that the usurping lords who seized on the
government of the free Lombard cities, had no regard for any
rule of government save sheer tyranny  — but a natural lord, and
no usurper, ought not to be a tyrant.</p>

<p id="id03180">24. Farmer: one who merely farms power or revenue for his
own purposes and his own gain.</p>

<p id="id03181">25. This was the first version of the Knight's tale. See the
introductory note, above</p>

<p id="id03182">26. Boece: Boethius' "De Consolatione Philosophiae;" to which
frequent reference is made in The Canterbury Tales. See, for
instances, note 91 to the Knight's Tale; and note 34 to the
Squire's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03183">27. A poem entitled "The Lamentation of Mary Magdalene,"
said to have been "taken out of St Origen," is included in the
editions of Chaucer; but its authenticity, and consequently its
identity with the poem here mentioned, are doubted.</p>

<p id="id03184">28. For the story of Alcestis, see note 11 to "The Court of
Love."</p>

<p id="id03185">29. "For he who gives a gift, or doth a grace,<br>

     Do it betimes, his thank is well the more"<br>

A paraphrase of the well-known proverb, "Bis dat qui cito dat."<br>

("He gives twice who gives promptly")<br>
</p>

<p id="id03186">30. The same prohibition occurs in the Fifteenth Statute of "The
Court of Love."</p>

<p id="id03187">31. Chaucer is always careful to allege his abstinence from the
pursuits of gallantry; he does so prominently in "The Court of
Love," "The Assembly of Fowls," and "The House of Fame."</p>

<p id="id03188">32. Pity runneth soon in gentle heart: the same is said of
Theseus, in The Knight's Tale, and of Canace, by the falcon, in
The Squire's Tale.</p>

<p id="id03189">33. Stellify: assign to a place among the stars; as Jupiter did to
Andromeda and Cassiopeia.</p>

<p id="id03190">34. Agathon: there was an Athenian dramatist of this name,
who might have made the virtues and fortunes of Alcestis his
theme; but the reference is too vague for the author to be
identified with any confidence.</p>

<p id="id03238">1. Chaucer's A. B. C. — a prayer to the Virgin, in twenty three
verses, beginning with the letters of the alphabet in their
order — is said to have been written "at the request of Blanche,
Duchess of Lancaster, as a prayer for her private use, being a
woman in her religion very devout." It was first printed in
Speght's edition of 1597.</p>

<p id="id03239">2. La Priere De Nostre Dame: French, "The Prayer of Our
Lady."</p>

<p id="id03240">3. Thieves seven: i.e. the seven deadly sins</p>

<p id="id03241">4. Mary's name recalls the waters of "Marah" or bitterness
(Exod. xv. 23), or the prayer of Naomi in her grief that she
might be called not Naomi, but "Mara" (Ruth i. 20). Mary,
however, is understood to mean "exalted."</p>

<p id="id03242">5. A typical representation. See The Prioress's Tale, third
stanza.</p>

<p id="id03243">6. The reference evidently is to Luke i. 38 — "Ecce ancilla
Domini," ("Behold the handmaid of the Lord") the Virgin's
humble answer to Gabriel at the Annunciation.</p>

<p id="id03244">7. "Xpe" represents the Greek letters chi rho epsilon, and is a
contraction for "Christe."</p>

<p id="id03245">8. According to tradition, the soldier who struck the Saviour to
the heart with his spear was named Longeus, and was blind;
but, touching his eyes by chance with the mingled blood and
water that flowed down the shaft upon his hands, he was
instantly restored to sight.</p>

<p id="id03246">9. "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
uncleanness" (Zech. xiii. 1).</p>

<p id="id03273" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Tyrwhitt, founding on the reference to the Wife of Bath,
places this among Chaucer's latest compositions; and states that
one Peter de Bukton held the office of king's escheator for
Yorkshire in 1397. In some of the old editions, the verses were
made the Envoy to the Book of the Duchess Blanche — in very
bad taste, when we consider that the object of that poem was to
console John of Gaunt under the loss of his wife.</p>
