      CHAPTER XVI.
    

      A FREE AND LEGISLATIVE PEOPLE.
    

      Considering that all public power was now suspended, and that the habitual
      restraint of the people had suddenly ceased, I shuddered with the
      apprehension that they would fall into the dissolution of anarchy. But,
      taking their affairs into immediate deliberation, they said:
    

      It is not enough that we have freed ourselves from tyrants and parasites;
      we must prevent their return. We are men, and experience has abundantly
      taught us that every man is fond of power, and wishes to enjoy it at the
      expense of others. It is necessary, then, to guard against a propensity
      which is the source of discord; we must establish certain rules of duty
      and of right. But the knowledge of our rights, and the estimation of our
      duties, are so abstract and difficult as to require all the time and all
      the faculties of a man. Occupied in our own affairs, we have not leisure
      for these studies; nor can we exercise these functions in our own persons.
      Let us choose, then, among ourselves, such persons as are capable of this
      employment. To them we will delegate our powers to institute our
      government and laws. They shall be the representatives of our wills and of
      our interests. And in order to attain the fairest representation possible
      of our wills and our interests, let it be numerous, and composed of men
      resembling ourselves.
    

      Having made the election of a numerous body of delegates, the people thus
      addressed them:
    

      We have hitherto lived in a society formed by chance, without fixed
      agreements, without free conventions, without a stipulation of rights,
      without reciprocal engagements,—and a multitude of disorders and
      evils have arisen from this precarious state. We are now determined on
      forming a regular compact; and we have chosen you to adjust the articles.
      Examine, then, with care what ought to be its basis and its conditions;
      consider what is the end and the principles of every association;
      recognize the rights which every member brings, the powers which he
      delegates, and those which he reserves to himself. Point out to us the
      rules of conduct—the basis of just and equitable laws. Prepare for
      us a new system of government; for we realize that the one which has
      hitherto guided us is corrupt. Our fathers have wandered in the paths of
      ignorance, and habit has taught us to follow in their footsteps.
      Everything has been done by fraud, violence, and delusion; and the true
      laws of morality and reason are still obscure. Clear up, then, their
      chaos; trace out their connection; publish their code, and we will adopt
      it.
    

      And the people raised a large throne, in the form of a pyramid, and
      seating on it the men they had chosen, said to them:
    

      We raise you to-day above us, that you may better discover the whole of
      our relations, and be above the reach of our passions. But remember that
      you are our fellow-citizens; that the power we confer on you is our own;
      that we deposit it with you, but not as a property or a heritage; that you
      must be the first to obey the laws you make; that to-morrow you redescend
      among us, and that you will have acquired no other right but that of our
      esteem and gratitude. And consider what a tribute of glory the world,
      which reveres so many apostles of error, will bestow on the first assembly
      of rational men, who shall have declared the unchangeable principles of
      justice, and consecrated, in the face of tyrants, the rights of nations.
