      CHAPTER XVII.
    

      UNIVERSAL BASIS OF ALL RIGHT AND ALL LAW.
    

      The men chosen by the people to investigate the true principles of morals
      and of reason then proceeded in the sacred object of their mission; and,
      after a long examination, having discovered a fundamental and universal
      principle, a legislator arose and said to the people:
    

      Here is the primordial basis, the physical origin of all justice and of
      all right.
    

      Whatever be the active power, the moving cause, that governs the universe,
      since it has given to all men the same organs, the same sensations, and
      the same wants, it has thereby declared that it has given to all the same
      right to the use of its treasures, and that all men are equal in the order
      of nature.
    

      And, since this power has given to each man the necessary means of
      preserving his own existence, it is evident that it has constituted them
      all independent one of another; that it has created them free; that no one
      is subject to another; that each one is absolute proprietor of his own
      person.
    

      Equality and liberty are, therefore, two essential attributes of man, two
      laws of the Divinity, constitutional and unchangeable, like the physical
      properties of matter.
    

      Now, every individual being absolute master of his own person, it follows
      that a full and free consent is a condition indispensable to all contracts
      and all engagements.
    

      Again, since each individual is equal to another, it follows that the
      balance of what is received and of what is given, should be strictly in
      equilibrium; so that the idea of justice, of equity, necessarily imports
      that of equality.*
    

     * The etymology of the words themselves trace out to us this
     connection: equilibrium, equalitas, equitas, are all of one
     family, and the physical idea of equality, in the scales of
     a balance, is the source and type of all the rest.


      Equality and liberty are therefore the physical and unalterable basis of
      every union of men in society, and of course the necessary and generating
      principle of every law and of every system of regular government.*
    

     * In the Declaration of Rights, there is an inversion of
     ideas in the first article, liberty being placed before
     equality, from which it in reality springs.  This defect is
     not to be wondered at; the science of the rights of man is a
     new science: it was invented yesterday by the Americans,
     to-day the French are perfecting it, but there yet remains a
     great deal to be done.  In the ideas that constitute it
     there is a genealogical order which, from us basis, physical
     equality, to the minutest and most remote branches of
     government, ought to proceed in an uninterrupted series of
     inferences.


      A disregard of this basis has introduced in your nation, and in every
      other, those disorders which have finally roused you. It is by returning
      to this rule that you may reform them, and reorganize a happy order of
      society.
    

      But observe, this reorganization will occasion a violent shock in your
      habits, your fortunes, and your prejudices. Vicious contracts and abusive
      claims must be dissolved, unjust distinctions and ill founded property
      renounced; you must indeed recur for a moment to a state of nature.
      Consider whether you can consent to so many sacrifices.
    

      Then, reflecting on the cupidity inherent in the heart of man, I thought
      that this people would renounce all ideas of amelioration.
    

      But, in a moment, a great number of men, advancing toward the pyramid,
      made a solemn abjuration of all their distinctions and all their riches.
    

      Establish for us, said they, the laws of equality and liberty; we will
      possess nothing in future but on the title of justice.
    

      Equality, liberty, justice,â€”these shall be our code, and shall be
      written on our standards.
    

      And the people immediately raised a great standard, inscribed with these
      three words, in three different colors. They displayed it over the pyramid
      of the legislators, and for the first time the flag of universal justice
      floated on the face of the earth.
    

      And the people raised before the pyramid a new altar, on which they placed
      a golden balance, a sword, and a book with this inscription:
    

      TO EQUAL LAW, WHICH JUDGES AND PROTECTS.
    

      And having surrounded the pyramid and the altar with a vast amphitheatre,
      all the people took their seats to hear the publication of the law. And
      millions of men, raising at once their hands to heaven, took the solemn
      oath to live equal, free, and just; to respect their reciprocal properties
      and rights; to obey the law and its regularly chosen representatives.
    

      A spectacle so impressive and sublime, so replete with generous emotions,
      moved me to tears; and addressing myself to the Genius, I exclaimed: Let
      me now live, for in future I have everything to hope.
