      CHAPTER XIV.
    

      THE GREAT OBSTACLE TO IMPROVEMENT.
    

      The Genius ceased. But preoccupied with melancholy thoughts, my mind
      resisted persuasion; fearing, however, to shock him by my resistance, I
      remained silent. After a while, turning to me with a look which pierced my
      soul, he said:
    

      Thou art silent, and thy heart is agitated with thoughts which it dares
      not utter.
    

      At last, troubled and terrified, I replied:
    

      O Genius, pardon my weakness. Doubtless thy mouth can utter nothing but
      truth; but thy celestial intelligence can seize its rays, where my gross
      faculties can discern nothing but clouds. I confess it; conviction has not
      penetrated my soul, and I feared that my doubts might offend thee.
    

      And what is doubt, replied he, that it should be a crime? Can man feel
      otherwise than as he is affected? If a truth be palpable, and of
      importance in practice, let us pity him that misconceives it. His
      punishment will arise from his blindness. If it be uncertain or equivocal,
      how is he to find in it what it has not? To believe without evidence or
      proof, is an act of ignorance and folly. The credulous man loses himself
      in a labyrinth of contradictions; the man of sense examines and discusses,
      that he may be consistent in his opinions. The honest man will bear
      contradiction; because it gives rise to evidence. Violence is the argument
      of falsehood; and to impose a creed by authority is the act and indication
      of a tyrant.
    

      O Genius, said I, encouraged by these words, since my reason is free, I
      strive in vain to entertain the flattering hope with which you endeavor to
      console me. The sensible and virtuous soul is easily caught with dreams of
      happiness; but a cruel reality constantly awakens it to suffering and
      wretchedness. The more I meditate on the nature of man, the more I examine
      the present state of societies, the less possible it appears to realize a
      world of wisdom and felicity. I cast my eye over the whole of our
      hemisphere; I perceive in no place the germ, nor do I foresee the
      instinctive energy of a happy revolution. All Asia lies buried in profound
      darkness. The Chinese, governed by an insolent despotism,* by strokes of
      the bamboo and the cast of lots, restrained by an immutable code of
      gestures, and by the radical vices of an ill-constructed language,**
      appear to be in their abortive civilization nothing but a race of
      automatons. The Indian, borne down by prejudices, and enchained in the
      sacred fetters of his castes, vegetates in an incurable apathy. The
      Tartar, wandering or fixed, always ignorant and ferocious, lives in the
      savageness of his ancestors. The Arab, endowed with a happy genius, loses
      its force and the fruits of his virtue in the anarchy of his tribes and
      the jealousy of his families. The African, degraded from the rank of man,
      seems irrevocably doomed to servitude. In the North I see nothing but
      vilified serfs, herds of men with which landlords stock their estates.
      Ignorance, tyranny, and wretchedness have everywhere stupified the
      nations; and vicious habits, depraving the natural senses, have destroyed
      the very instinct of happiness and of truth.
    

     * The emperor of China calls himself the son of heaven; that
     is, of God: for in the opinion of the Chinese, the material
     of heaven, the arbiter of fatality, is the Deity himself.
     "The emperor only shows himself once in ten months, lest the
     people, accustomed to see him, might lose their respect; for
     he holds it as a maxim that power can only be supported by
     force, that the people have no idea of justice, and are not
     to be governed but by coercion."  Narrative of two Mahometan
     travellers in 851 and 877, translated by the Abbe Renaudot
     in 1718.

     Notwithstanding what is asserted by the missionaries, this
     situation has undergone no change.  The bamboo still reigns
     in China, and the son of heaven bastinades, for the most
     trivial fault, the Mandarin, who in his turn bastinades the
     people.  The Jesuits may tell us that this is the best
     governed country in the world, and its inhabitants the
     happiest of men: but a single letter from Amyot has
     convinced me that China is a truly Turkish government, and
     the account of Sonnerat confirms it.  See Vol. II. of Voyage
     aux Indes, in 4to.

     ** As long as the Chinese shall in writing make use of their
     present characters, they can be expected to make no progress
     in civilization.  The necessary introductory step must be
     the giving them an alphabet like our own, or of substituting
     in the room of their language that of the Tartars.  The
     improvement made in the latter by M. de Lengles, is
     calculated to introduce this change. See the Mantchou
     alphabet, the production of a mind truly learned in the
     formation of language.


      In some parts of Europe, indeed, reason has begun to dawn, but even there,
      do nations partake of the knowledge of individuals? Are the talents and
      genius of governors turned to the benefit of the people? And those nations
      which call themselves polished, are they not the same that for the last
      three centuries have filled the earth with their injustice? Are they not
      those who, under the pretext of commerce, have desolated India,
      depopulated a new continent, and, at present, subject Africa to the most
      barbarous slavery? Can liberty be born from the bosom of despots? and
      shall justice be rendered by the hands of piracy and avarice? O Genius, I
      have seen the civilized countries; and the mockery of their wisdom has
      vanished before my sight. I saw wealth accumulated in the hands of a few,
      and the multitude poor and destitute. I have seen all rights, all powers
      concentered in certain classes, and the mass of the people passive and
      dependent. I have seen families of princes, but no families of the nation.
      I have seen government interests, but no public interests or spirit. I
      have seen that all the science of government was to oppress prudently; and
      the refined servitude of polished nations appeared to me only the more
      irremediable.
    

      One obstacle above all has profoundly struck my mind. On looking over the
      world, I have seen it divided into twenty different systems of religion.
      Every nation has received, or formed, opposite opinions; and every one
      ascribing to itself the exclusive possession of the truth, must believe
      the other to be wrong. Now if, as must be the fact in this discordance of
      opinion, the greater part are in error, and are honest in it, then it
      follows that our mind embraces falsehood as it does truth; and if so, how
      is it to be enlightened? When prejudice has once seized the mind, how is
      it to be dissipated? How shall we remove the bandage from our eyes, when
      the first article in every creed, the first dogma in all religion, is the
      absolute proscription of doubt, the interdiction of examination, and the
      rejection of our own judgment? How is truth to make herself known?â€”If
      she resorts to arguments and proofs, the timid man stifles the voice of
      his own conscience; if she invokes the authority of celestial powers, he
      opposes it with another authority of the same origin, with which he is
      preoccupied; and he treats all innovation as blasphemy. Thus man in his
      blindness, has riveted his own chains, and surrendered himself forever,
      without defence, to the sport of his ignorance and his passions.
    

      To dissolve such fatal chains, a miraculous concurrence of happy events
      would be necessary. A whole nation, cured of the delirium of superstition,
      must be inaccessible to the impulse of fanaticism. Freed from the yoke of
      false doctrine, a whole people must impose upon itself that of true
      morality and reason. This people should be courageous and prudent, wise
      and docile. Each individual, knowing his rights, should not transgress
      them. The poor should know how to resist seduction, and the rich the
      allurements of avarice. There should be found leaders disinterested and
      just, and their tyrants should be seized with a spirit of madness and
      folly. This people, recovering its rights, should feel its inability to
      exercise them in person, and should name its representatives. Creator of
      its magistrates, it should know at once to respect them and to judge them.
      In the sudden reform of a whole nation, accustomed to live by abuses, each
      individual displaced should bear with patience his privations, and submit
      to a change of habits. This nation should have the courage to conquer its
      liberty; the power to defend it, the wisdom to establish it, and the
      generosity to extend it to others. And can we ever expect the union of so
      many circumstances? But suppose that chance in its infinite combinations
      should produce them, shall I see those fortunate days. Will not my ashes
      long ere then be mouldering in the tomb?
    

      Here, sunk in sorrow, my oppressed heart no longer found utterance. The
      Genius answered not, but I heard him whisper to himself:
    

      Let us revive the hope of this man; for if he who loves his fellow
      creatures be suffered to despair, what will become of nations? The past is
      perhaps too discouraging; I must anticipate futurity, and disclose to the
      eye of virtue the astonishing age that is ready to begin; that, on viewing
      the object she desires, she may be animated with new ardor, and redouble
      her efforts to attain it.
