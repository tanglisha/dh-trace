      CHAPTER VI.
    

      THE PRIMITIVE STATE OF MAN.
    

      Formed naked in body and in mind, man at first found himself thrown, as it
      were by chance, on a rough and savage land: an orphan, abandoned by the
      unknown power which had produced him, he saw not by his side beings
      descended from heaven to warn him of those wants which arise only from his
      senses, nor to instruct him in those duties which spring only from his
      wants. Like to other animals, without experience of the past, without
      foresight of the future, he wandered in the bosom of the forest, guided
      only and governed by the affections of his nature. By the pain of hunger,
      he was led to seek food and provide for his subsistence; by the inclemency
      of the air, he was urged to cover his body, and he made him clothes; by
      the attraction of a powerful pleasure, he approached a being like himself,
      and he perpetuated his kind.
    

      Thus the impressions which he received from every object, awakening his
      faculties, developed by degrees his understanding, and began to instruct
      his profound ignorance: his wants excited industry, dangers formed his
      courage; he learned to distinguish useful from noxious plants, to combat
      the elements, to seize his prey, to defend his life; and thus he
      alleviated its miseries.
    

      Thus self-love, aversion to pain, the desire of happiness, were the simple
      and powerful excitements which drew man from the savage and barbarous
      condition in which nature had placed him. And now, when his life is
      replete with enjoyments, when he may count each day by the comforts it
      brings, he may applaud himself and say:
    

      "It is I who have produced the comforts which surround me; it is I who am
      the author of my own happiness; a safe dwelling, convenient clothing,
      abundant and wholesome nourishment, smiling fields, fertile hills,
      populous empires, all is my work; without me this earth, given up to
      disorder, would have been but a filthy fen, a wild wood, a dreary desert."
    

      Yes, creative man, receive my homage! Thou hast measured the span of the
      heavens, calculated the volume of the stars, arrested the lightning in its
      clouds, subdued seas and storms, subjected all the elements. Ah! how are
      so many sublime energies allied to so many errors?
