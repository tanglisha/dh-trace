      CHAPTER VIII.
    

      SOURCES OF THE EVILS OF SOCIETY.
    

      In truth, scarcely were the faculties of men developed, when, inveigled by
      objects which gratify the senses, they gave themselves up to unbridled
      desires. The sweet sensations which nature had attached to their real
      wants, to endear to them their existence, no longer satisfied them. Not
      content with the abundance offered by the earth or produced by industry,
      they wished to accumulate enjoyments and coveted those possessed by their
      fellow men. The strong man rose up against the feeble, to take from him
      the fruit of his labor; the feeble invoked another feeble one to repel the
      violence. Two strong ones then said:
    

      "Why fatigue ourselves to produce enjoyments which we may find in the
      hands of the weak? Let us join and despoil them; they shall labor for us,
      and we will enjoy without labor."
    

      And the strong associating for oppression and the weak for resistance, men
      mutually afflicted each other; and a general and fatal discord spread over
      the earth, in which the passions, assuming a thousand new forms, have
      generated a continued chain of misfortunes.
    

      Thus the same self-love which, moderate and prudent, was a principle of
      happiness and perfection, becoming blind and disordered, was transformed
      into a corrupting poison; and cupidity, offspring and companion of
      ignorance, became the cause of all the evils that have desolated the
      earth.
    

      Yes, ignorance and cupidity! these are the twin sources of all the
      torments of man! Biased by these into false ideas of happiness, he has
      mistaken or broken the laws of nature in his own relation with external
      objects; and injuring his own existence, has violated individual morality;
      shutting through these his heart to compassion, and his mind to justice,
      he has injured and afflicted his equal, and violated social morality. From
      ignorance and cupidity, man has armed against man, family against family,
      tribe against tribe; and the earth is become a theatre of blood, of
      discord, and of rapine. By ignorance and cupidity, a secret war,
      fermenting in the bosom of every state, has separated citizen from
      citizen; and the same society has divided itself into oppressors and
      oppressed, into masters and slaves; by these, the heads of a nation,
      sometimes insolent and audacious, have forged its chains within its own
      bowels; and mercenary avarice has founded political despotism. Sometimes,
      hypocritical and cunning, they have called from heaven a lying power, and
      a sacrilegious yoke; and credulous cupidity has founded religious
      despotism. By these have been perverted the ideas of good and evil, just
      and unjust, vice and virtue; and nations have wandered in a labyrinth of
      errors and calamities.
    

      The cupidity of man and his ignorance,â€”these are the evil genii
      which have wasted the earth! These are the decrees of fate which have
      overthrown empires! These are the celestial anathemas which have smitten
      these walls once so glorious, and converted the splendor of a populous
      city into a solitude of mourning and of ruins! But as in the bosom of man
      have sprung all the evils which have afflicted his life, there he also is
      to seek and to find their remedies.
