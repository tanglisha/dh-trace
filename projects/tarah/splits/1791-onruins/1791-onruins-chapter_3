      CHAPTER III.
    

      THE APPARITION.
    

      While thus absorbed, a sound struck my ear, like the agitation of a
      flowing robe, or that of slow footsteps on dry and rustling grass.
      Startled, I opened my mantle, and looking about with fear and trembling,
      suddenly, on my left, by the glimmering light of the moon, through the
      columns and ruins of a neighboring temple, I thought I saw an apparition,
      pale, clothed in large and flowing robes, such as spectres are painted
      rising from their tombs. I shuddered: and while agitated and hesitating
      whether to fly or to advance toward the object, a distinct voice, in
      solemn tones, pronounced these words:
    

      How long will man importune heaven with unjust complaint? How long, with
      vain clamors, will he accuse Fate as the author of his calamities? Will he
      forever shut his eyes to the light, and his heart to the admonitions of
      truth and reason? The light of truth meets him everywhere; yet he sees it
      not! The voice of reason strikes his ear; and he hears it not! Unjust man!
      if for a moment thou canst suspend the delusion which fascinates thy
      senses, if thy heart can comprehend the language of reason, interrogate
      these ruins! Read the lessons which they present to thee! And you,
      evidences of twenty centuries, holy temples! venerable tombs! walls once
      so glorious, appear in the cause of nature herself! Approach the tribunal
      of sound reason, and bear testimony against unjust accusations! Come and
      confound the declamations of a false wisdom or hypocritical piety, and
      avenge the heavens and the earth of man who calumniates them both!
    

      What is that blind fatality, which without order and without law, sports
      with the destiny of mortals? What is that unjust necessity, which
      confounds the effect of actions, whether of wisdom or of folly? In what
      consist the anathemas of heaven over this land? Where is that divine
      malediction which perpetuates the abandonment of these fields? Say,
      monuments of past ages! have the heavens changed their laws and the earth
      its motion? Are the fires of the sun extinct in the regions of space? Do
      the seas no longer emit their vapors? Are the rains and the dews suspended
      in the air? Do the mountains withhold their springs? Are the streams dried
      up? And do the plants no longer bear fruit and seed? Answer, generation of
      falsehood and iniquity, hath God deranged the primitive and settled order
      of things which he himself assigned to nature? Hath heaven denied to
      earth, and earth to its inhabitants, the blessings they formerly
      dispensed? If nothing hath changed in the creation, if the same means now
      exist which before existed, why then are not the present what former
      generations were? Ah! it is falsely that you accuse fate and heaven! it is
      unjustly that you accuse God as the cause of your evils! Say, perverse and
      hypocritical race! if these places are desolate, if these powerful cities
      are reduced to solitude, is it God who has caused their ruin? Is it his
      hand which has overthrown these walls, destroyed these temples, mutilated
      these columns, or is it the hand of man? Is it the arm of God which has
      carried the sword into your cities, and fire into your fields, which has
      slaughtered the people, burned the harvests, rooted up trees, and ravaged
      the pastures, or is it the hand of man? And when, after the destruction of
      crops, famine has ensued, is it the vengeance of God which has produced
      it, or the mad fury of mortals? When, sinking under famine, the people
      have fed on impure aliments, if pestilence ensues, is it the wrath of God
      which sends it, or the folly of man? When war, famine and pestilence, have
      swept away the inhabitants, if the earth remains a desert, is it God who
      has depopulated it? Is it his rapacity which robs the husbandman, ravages
      the fruitful fields, and wastes the earth, or is it the rapacity of those
      who govern? Is it his pride which excites murderous wars, or the pride of
      kings and their ministers? Is it the venality of his decisions which
      overthrows the fortunes of families, or the corruption of the organs of
      the law? Are they his passions which, under a thousand forms, torment
      individuals and nations, or are they the passions of man? And if, in the
      anguish of their miseries, they see not the remedies, is it the ignorance
      of God which is to blame, or their ignorance? Cease then, mortals, to
      accuse the decrees of Fate, or the judgments of the Divinity! If God is
      good, will he be the author of your misery? If he is just, will he be the
      accomplice of your crimes? No, the caprice of which man complains is not
      the caprice of fate; the darkness that misleads his reason is not the
      darkness of God; the source of his calamities is not in the distant
      heavens, it is beside him on the earth; it is not concealed in the bosom
      of the divinity; it dwells within himself, he bears it in his own heart.
    

      Thou murmurest and sayest: What! have an infidel people then enjoyed the
      blessings of heaven and earth? Are the holy people of God less fortunate
      than the races of impiety? Deluded man! where then is the contradiction
      which offends thee? Where is the inconsistency which thou imputest to the
      justice of heaven? Take into thine own hands the balance of rewards and
      punishments, of causes and effects. Say: when these infidels observed the
      laws of the heavens and the earth, when they regulated well-planned labors
      by the order of the seasons and the course of the stars, should the
      Almighty have disturbed the equilibrium of the universe to defeat their
      prudence? When their hands cultivated these fields with toil and care,
      should he have diverted the course of the rains, suspended the refreshing
      dews, and planted crops of thorns? When, to render these arid fields
      productive, their industry constructed aqueducts, dug canals, and led the
      distant waters across the desert, should he have dried up their sources in
      the mountains? Should he have blasted the harvests which art had
      nourished, wasted the plains which peace had peopled, overthrown cities
      which labor had created, or disturbed the order established by the wisdom
      of man? And what is that infidelity which founded empires by its prudence,
      defended them by its valor, and strengthened them by its justice—which
      built powerful cities, formed capacious ports, drained pestilential
      marshes, covered the ocean with ships, the earth with inhabitants; and,
      like the creative spirit, spread life and motion throughout the world? If
      such be infidelity, what then is the true faith? Doth sanctity consist in
      destruction? The God who peoples the air with birds, the earth with
      animals, the waters with fishes—the God who animates all nature—is
      he then a God of ruins and tombs? Demands he devastation for homage, and
      conflagration for sacrifice? Requires he groans for hymns, murderers for
      votaries, a ravaged and desolate earth for his temple? Behold then, holy
      and believing people, what are your works! behold the fruits of your
      piety! You have massacred the people, burned their cities, destroyed
      cultivation, reduced the earth to a solitude; and you ask the reward of
      your works! Miracles then must be performed! The people whom you
      extirpated must be recalled to life, the walls rebuilt which you have
      overthrown, the harvests reproduced which you have destroyed, the waters
      regathered which you have dispersed; the laws, in fine, of heaven and
      earth reversed; those laws, established by God himself, in demonstration
      of his magnificence and wisdom; those eternal laws, anterior to all codes,
      to all the prophets those immutable laws, which neither the passions nor
      the ignorance of man can pervert. But that passion which mistaketh, that
      ignorance which observeth neither causes nor effects, hath said in its
      folly: "All things flow from chance; a blind fatality poureth out good and
      evil upon the earth; success is not to the prudent, nor felicity to the
      wise;" or, assuming the language of hypocrisy, she hath said, "all things
      are from God; he taketh pleasure in deceiving wisdom and confounding
      reason." And Ignorance, applauding herself in her malice, hath said, "thus
      will I place myself on a par with that science which confounds me—thus
      will I excel that prudence which fatigues and torments me." And Avarice
      hath added: "I will oppress the weak, and devour the fruits of his labors;
      and I will say, it is fate which hath so ordained." But I! I swear by the
      laws of heaven and earth, and by the law which is written in the heart of
      man, that the hypocrite shall be deceived in his cunning—the
      oppressor in his rapacity! The sun shall change his course, before folly
      shall prevail over wisdom and knowledge, or ignorance surpass prudence, in
      the noble and sublime art of procuring to man his true enjoyments, and of
      building his happiness on an enduring foundation.
