      CHAPTER I.
    

      THE JOURNEY.
    

      In the eleventh year of the reign of Abd-ul-Hamid, son of Ahmid, emperor
      of the Turks; when the Nogais-Tartars were driven from the Crimea, and a
      Mussulman prince of the blood of Gengis-Kahn became the vassal and guard
      of a Christian woman and queen,* I was travelling in the Ottoman
      dominions, and through those provinces which were anciently the kingdoms
      of Egypt and Syria.
    

     * In the eleventh year of Abd-ul-Hamid, that is 1784 of the
     Christian era, and 1198 of the Hegira.  The emigration of
     the Tartars took place in March, immediately on the
     manifesto of the empress, declaring the Crimea to be
     incorporated with Russia.  The Mussulman prince of the blood
     of Gengis-khan was Chahin-Guerai. Gengis-Khan was borne and
     served by the kings whom he conquered: Chahin, on the
     contrary, after selling his country for a pension of eighty
     thousand roubles, accepted the commission of captain of
     guards to Catherine II.  He afterwards returned home, and
     according to custom was strangled by the Turks.


      My whole attention bent on whatever concerns the happiness of man in a
      social state, I visited cities, and studied the manners of their
      inhabitants; entered palaces, and observed the conduct of those who
      govern; wandered over fields, and examined the condition of those who
      cultivated them: and nowhere perceiving aught but robbery and devastation,
      tyranny and wretchedness, my heart was oppressed with sorrow and
      indignation.
    

      I saw daily on my road fields abandoned, villages deserted, and cities in
      ruin. Often I met with ancient monuments, wrecks of temples, palaces and
      fortresses, columns, aqueducts and tombs. This spectacle led me to
      meditate on times past, and filled my mind with contemplations the most
      serious and profound.
    

      Arrived at the city of Hems, on the border of the Orontes, and being in
      the neighborhood of Palmyra of the desert, I resolved to visit its
      celebrated ruins. After three days journeying through arid deserts, having
      traversed the Valley of Caves and Sepulchres, on issuing into the plain, I
      was suddenly struck with a scene of the most stupendous ruinsâ€”a
      countless multitude of superb columns, stretching in avenues beyond the
      reach of sight. Among them were magnificent edifices, some entire, others
      in ruins; the earth every where strewed with fragments of cornices,
      capitals, shafts, entablatures, pilasters, all of white marble, and of the
      most exquisite workmanship. After a walk of three-quarters of an hour
      along these ruins, I entered the enclosure of a vast edifice, formerly a
      temple dedicated to the Sun; and accepting the hospitality of some poor
      Arabian peasants, who had built their hovels on the area of the temple, I
      determined to devote some days to contemplate at leisure the beauty of
      these stupendous ruins.
    

      Daily I visited the monuments which covered the plain; and one evening,
      absorbed in reflection, I had advanced to the Valley of Sepulchres. I
      ascended the heights which surround it from whence the eye commands the
      whole group of ruins and the immensity of the desert. The sun had sunk
      below the horizon: a red border of light still marked his track behind the
      distant mountains of Syria; the full-orbed moon was rising in the east, on
      a blue ground, over the plains of the Euphrates; the sky was clear, the
      air calm and serene; the dying lamp of day still softened the horrors of
      approaching darkness; the refreshing night breezes attempered the sultry
      emanations from the heated earth; the herdsmen had given their camels to
      repose, the eye perceived no motion on the dusky and uniform plain;
      profound silence rested on the desert; the howlings only of the jackal,*
      and the solemn notes of the bird of night, were heard at distant
      intervals. Darkness now increased, and through the dusk could only be
      discerned the pale phantasms of columns and walls. The solitude of the
      place, the tranquillity of the hour, the majesty of the scene, impressed
      on my mind a religious pensiveness. The aspect of a great city deserted,
      the memory of times past, compared with its present state, all elevated my
      mind to high contemplations. I sat on the shaft of a column, my elbow
      reposing on my knee, and head reclining on my hand, my eyes fixed,
      sometimes on the desert, sometimes on the ruins, and fell into a profound
      reverie.
    

     * An animal resembling a dog and a fox.  It preys on other
     small animals, and upon the bodies of the dead on the field
     of battle. It is the Canis aureus of Linnaeus.
