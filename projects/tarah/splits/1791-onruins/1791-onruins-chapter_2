      CHAPTER II.
    

      THE REVERIE.
    

      Here, said I, once flourished an opulent city; here was the seat of a
      powerful empire. Yes! these places now so wild and desolate, were once
      animated by a living multitude; a busy crowd thronged in these streets,
      now so solitary. Within these walls, where now reigns the silence of
      death, the noise of the arts, and the shouts of joy and festivity
      incessantly resounded; these piles of marble were regular palaces; these
      fallen columns adorned the majesty of temples; these ruined galleries
      surrounded public places. Here assembled a numerous people for the sacred
      duties of their religion, and the anxious cares of their subsistence; here
      industry, parent of enjoyments, collected the riches of all climes, and
      the purple of Tyre was exchanged for the precious thread of Serica;* the
      soft tissues of Cassimere for the sumptuous tapestry of Lydia; the amber
      of the Baltic for the pearls and perfumes of Arabia; the gold of Ophir for
      the tin of Thule.
    

     * The precious thread of Serica.—That is, the silk
     originally derived from the mountainous country where the
     great wall terminates, and which appears to have been the
     cradle of the Chinese empire.  The tissues of Cassimere.—
     The shawls which Ezekiel seems to have described under the
     appellation of Choud-choud.  The gold of Ophir.—This
     country, which was one of the twelve Arab cantons, and which
     has so much and so unsuccessfully been sought for by the
     antiquarians, has left, however, some trace of itself in
     Ofor, in the province of Oman, upon the Persian Gulf,
     neighboring on one side to the Sabeans, who are celebrated
     by Strabo for their abundance of gold, and on the other to
     Aula or Hevila, where the pearl fishery was carried on.  See
     the 27th chapter of Ezekiel, which gives a very curious and
     extensive picture of the commerce of Asia at that period.


      And now behold what remains of this powerful city: a miserable skeleton!
      What of its vast domination: a doubtful and obscure remembrance! To the
      noisy concourse which thronged under these porticoes, succeeds the
      solitude of death. The silence of the grave is substituted for the busy
      hum of public places; the affluence of a commercial city is changed into
      wretched poverty; the palaces of kings have become a den of wild beasts;
      flocks repose in the area of temples, and savage reptiles inhabit the
      sanctuary of the gods. Ah! how has so much glory been eclipsed? how have
      so many labors been annihilated? Do thus perish then the works of men—thus
      vanish empires and nations?
    

      And the history of former times revived in my mind; I remembered those
      ancient ages when many illustrious nations inhabited these countries; I
      figured to myself the Assyrian on the banks of the Tygris, the Chaldean on
      the banks of the Euphrates, the Persian reigning from the Indus to the
      Mediterranean. I enumerated the kingdoms of Damascus and Idumea, of
      Jerusalem and Samaria, the warlike states of the Philistines, and the
      commercial republics of Phoenicia. This Syria, said I, now so depopulated,
      then contained a hundred flourishing cities, and abounded with towns,
      villages, and hamlets.* In all parts were seen cultivated fields,
      frequented roads, and crowded habitations. Ah! whither have flown those
      ages of life and abundance?—whither vanished those brilliant
      creations of human industry? Where are those ramparts of Nineveh, those
      walls of Babylon, those palaces of Persepolis, those temples of Balbec and
      of Jerusalem? Where are those fleets of Tyre, those dock-yards of Arad,
      those work-shops of Sidon, and that multitude of sailors, of pilots, of
      merchants, and of soldiers? Where those husbandmen, harvests, flocks, and
      all the creation of living beings in which the face of the earth rejoiced?
      Alas! I have passed over this desolate land! I have visited the palaces,
      once the scene of so much splendor, and I beheld nothing but solitude and
      desolation. I sought the ancient inhabitants and their works, and found
      nothing but a trace, like the foot-prints of a traveller over the sand.
      The temples are fallen, the palaces overthrown, the ports filled up, the
      cities destroyed; and the earth, stripped of inhabitants, has become a
      place of sepulchres. Great God! whence proceed such fatal revolutions?
      What causes have so changed the fortunes of these countries? Wherefore are
      so many cities destroyed? Why has not this ancient population been
      reproduced and perpetuated?
    

     * According to Josephus and Strabo, there were in Syria
     twelve millions of souls, and the traces that remain of
     culture and habitation confirm the calculation.


      Thus absorbed in meditation, a crowd of new reflections continually poured
      in upon my mind. Every thing, continued I, bewilders my judgment, and
      fills my heart with trouble and uncertainty. When these countries enjoyed
      what constitutes the glory and happiness of man, they were inhabited by
      infidel nations: It was the Phoenician, offering human sacrifices to
      Moloch, who gathered into his stores the riches of all climates; it was
      the Chaldean, prostrate before his serpent-god,* who subjugated opulent
      cities, laid waste the palaces of kings, and despoiled the temples of the
      gods; it was the Persian, worshipper of fire, who received the tribute of
      a hundred nations; they were the inhabitants of this very city, adorers of
      the sun and stars, who erected so many monuments of prosperity and luxury.
      Numerous herds, fertile fields, abundant harvests—whatsoever should
      be the reward of piety—was in the hands of these idolaters. And now,
      when a people of saints and believers occupy these fields, all is become
      sterility and solitude. The earth, under these holy hands, produces only
      thorns and briers. Man soweth in anguish, and reapeth tears and cares.
      War, famine, pestilence, assail him by turns. And yet, are not these the
      children of the prophets? The Mussulman, Christian, Jew, are they not the
      elect children of God, loaded with favors and miracles? Why, then, do
      these privileged races no longer enjoy the same advantages? Why are these
      fields, sanctified by the blood of martyrs, deprived of their ancient
      fertility? Why have those blessings been banished hence, and transferred
      for so many ages to other nations and different climes?
    

     * The dragon Bell.


      At these words, revolving in my mind the vicissitudes which have
      transmitted the sceptre of the world to people so different in religion
      and manners from those in ancient Asia to the most recent of Europe, this
      name of a natal land revived in me the sentiment of my country; and
      turning my eyes towards France, I began to reflect on the situation in
      which I had left her.*
    

     * In the year 1782, at the close of the American war.


      I recalled her fields so richly cultivated, her roads so admirably
      constructed, her cities inhabited by a countless people, her fleets spread
      over every sea, her ports filled with the produce of both the Indies: and
      then comparing the activity of her commerce, the extent of her navigation,
      the magnificence of her buildings, the arts and industry of her
      inhabitants, with what Egypt and Syria had once possessed, I was gratified
      to find in modern Europe the departed splendor of Asia; but the charm of
      my reverie was soon dissolved by a last term of comparison. Reflecting
      that such had once been the activity of the places I was then
      contemplating, who knows, said I, but such may one day be the abandonment
      of our countries? Who knows if on the banks of the Seine, the Thames, the
      Zuyder-Zee, where now, in the tumult of so many enjoyments, the heart and
      the eye suffice not for the multitude of sensations,—who knows if
      some traveller, like myself, shall not one day sit on their silent ruins,
      and weep in solitude over the ashes of their inhabitants, and the memory
      of their former greatness.
    

      At these words, my eyes filled with tears: and covering my head with the
      fold of my mantle, I sank into gloomy meditations on all human affairs.
      Ah! hapless man, said I in my grief, a blind fatality sports with thy
      destiny!* A fatal necessity rules with the hand of chance the lot of
      mortals! But no: it is the justice of heaven fulfilling its decrees!—a
      God of mystery exercising his incomprehensible judgments! Doubtless he has
      pronounced a secret anathema against this land: blasting with maledictions
      the present, for the sins of past generations. Oh! who shall dare to
      fathom the depths of the Omnipotent?
    

     * Fatality is the universal and rooted prejudice of the
     East.  "It was written," is there the answer to every thing.
     Hence result an unconcern and apathy, the most powerful
     impediments to instruction and civilization.


      And sunk in profound melancholy, I remained motionless.
