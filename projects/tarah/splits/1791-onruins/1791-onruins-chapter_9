      CHAPTER IX.
    

      ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT AND LAWS.
    

      In fact, it soon happened that men, fatigued with the evils they
      reciprocally inflicted, began to sigh for peace; and reflecting on their
      misfortunes and the causes of them, they said:
    

      "We are mutually injuring each other by our passions; and, aiming to grasp
      every thing, we hold nothing. What one seizes to-day, another takes
      to-morrow, and our cupidity reacts upon ourselves. Let us establish
      judges, who shall arbitrate our rights, and settle our differences! When
      the strong shall rise against the weak, the judge shall restrain him, and
      dispose of our force to suppress violence; and the life and property of
      each shall be under the guarantee and protection of all; and all shall
      enjoy the good things of nature."
    

      Conventions were thus formed in society, sometimes express, sometimes
      tacit, which became the rule for the action of individuals, the measure of
      their rights, the law of their reciprocal relations; and persons were
      appointed to superintend their observance, to whom the people confided the
      balance to weigh rights, and the sword to punish transgressions.
    

      Thus was established among individuals a happy equilibrium of force and
      action, which constituted the common security. The name of equity and of
      justice was recognized and revered over the earth; every one, assured of
      enjoying in peace, the fruits of his toil, pursued with energy the objects
      of his attention; and industry, excited and maintained by the reality or
      the hope of enjoyment, developed, all the riches of art and of nature. The
      fields were covered with harvests, the valleys with flocks, the hills with
      fruits, the sea with vessels, and man became happy and powerful on the
      earth. Thus did his own wisdom repair the disorder which his imprudence
      had occasioned; and that wisdom was only the effect of his own
      organization. He respected the enjoyments of others in order to secure his
      own; and cupidity found its corrective in the enlightened love of self.
    

      Thus the love of self, the moving principle of every individual, becomes
      the necessary foundation of every association; and on the observance of
      that law of our nature has depended the fate of nations. Have the
      factitious and conventional laws tended to that object and accomplished
      that aim? Every one, urged by a powerful instinct, has displayed all the
      faculties of his being; and the sum of individual felicities has
      constituted the general felicity. Have these laws, on the contrary,
      restrained the effort of man toward his own happiness? His heart, deprived
      of its exciting principle, has languished in inactivity, and from the
      oppression of individuals has resulted the weakness of the state.
    

      As self-love, impetuous and improvident, is ever urging man against his
      equal, and consequently tends to dissolve society, the art of legislation
      and the merit of administrators consists in attempering the conflict of
      individual cupidities, in maintaining an equilibrium of powers, and
      securing to every one his happiness, in order that, in the shock of
      society against society, all the members may have a common interest in the
      preservation and defence of the public welfare.
    

      The internal splendor and prosperity of empires then, have had for their
      efficient cause the equity of their laws and government; and their
      respective external powers have been in proportion to the number of
      persons interested, and their degree of interest in the public welfare.
    

      On the other hand, the multiplication of men, by complicating their
      relations, having rendered the precise limitation of their rights
      difficult, the perpetual play of the passions having produced incidents
      not foreseen—their conventions having been vicious, inadequate, or
      nugatory—in fine, the authors of the laws having sometimes mistaken,
      sometimes disguised their objects; and their ministers, instead of
      restraining the cupidity of others, having given themselves up to their
      own; all these causes have introduced disorder and trouble into societies;
      and the viciousness of laws and the injustice of governments, flowing from
      cupidity and ignorance, have become the causes of the misfortunes of
      nations, and the subversion of states.
