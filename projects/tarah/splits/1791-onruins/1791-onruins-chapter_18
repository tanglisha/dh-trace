      CHAPTER XVIII.
    

      CONSTERNATION AND CONSPIRACY OF TYRANTS.
    

      But scarcely had the solemn voice of liberty and equality resounded
      through the earth, when a movement of confusion, of astonishment, arose in
      different nations. On the one hand, the people, warmed with desire, but
      wavering between hope and fear, between the sentiment of right and the
      habit of obedience, began to be in motion. The kings, on the other hand,
      suddenly awakened from the sleep of indolence and despotism, were alarmed
      for the safety of their thrones; while, on all sides, those clans of civil
      and religious tyrants, who deceive kings and oppress the people, were
      seized with rage and consternation; and, concerting their perfidious
      plans, they said: Woe to us, if this fatal cry of liberty comes to the
      ears of the multitude! Woe to us, if this pernicious spirit of justice be
      propagated!
    

      And, pointing to the floating banner, they continued:
    

      Consider what a swarm of evils are included in these three words! If all
      men are equal, where is our exclusive right to honors and to power? If all
      men are to be free, what becomes of our slaves, our vassals, our property?
      If all are equal in the civil state, where is our prerogative of birth, of
      inheritance? and what becomes of nobility? If they are all equal in the
      sight of God, what need of mediators?â€”where is the priesthood? Let
      us hasten, then, to destroy a germ so prolific, and so contagious. We must
      employ all our cunning against this innovation. We must frighten the
      kings, that they may join us in the cause. We must divide the people by
      national jealousies, and occupy them with commotions, wars, and conquests.
      They must be alarmed at the power of this free nation. Let us form a
      league against the common enemy, demolish that sacrilegious standard,
      overturn that throne of rebellion, and stifle in its birth the flame of
      revolution.
    

      And, indeed, the civil and religious tyrants of nations formed a general
      combination; and, multiplying their followers by force and seduction, they
      marched in hostile array against the free nation; and, surrounding the
      altar and the pyramid of natural law, they demanded with loud cries:
    

      What is this new and heretical doctrine? what this impious altar, this
      sacrilegious worship? True believers and loyal subjects! can you suppose
      that truth has been first discovered to-day, and that hitherto you have
      been walking in error? that those men, more fortunate than you, have the
      sole privilege of wisdom? And you, rebel and misguided nation, perceive
      you not that your new leaders are misleading you? that they destroy the
      principles of your faith, and overturn the religion of your ancestors? Ah,
      tremble! lest the wrath of heaven should kindle against you; and hasten by
      speedy repentance to retrieve your error.
    

      But, inaccessible to seduction as well as to fear, the free nation kept
      silence, and rising universally in arms, assumed an imposing attitude.
    

      And the legislator said to the chiefs of nations:
    

      If while we walked with a bandage on our eyes the light guided our steps,
      why, since we are no longer blindfold, should it fly from our search? If
      guides, who teach mankind to see for themselves, mislead and deceive them,
      what can be expected from those who profess to keep them in darkness?
    

      But hark, ye leaders of nations! If you possess the truth, show it to us,
      and we will receive it with gratitude, for we seek it with ardor, and have
      a great interest in finding it. We are men, and liable to be deceived; but
      you are also men, and equally fallible. Aid us then in this labyrinth,
      where the human race has wandered for so many ages; help us to dissipate
      the illusion of so many prejudices and vicious habits. Amid the shock of
      so many opinions which dispute for our acceptance, assist us in
      discovering the proper and distinctive character of truth. Let us this day
      terminate the long combat with error. Let us establish between it and
      truth a solemn contest, to which we will invite the opinions of men of all
      nations. Let us convoke a general assembly of the nations. Let them be
      judges in their own cause; and in the debate of all systems, let no
      champion, no argument, be wanting, either on the side of prejudice or of
      reason; and let the sentiment of a general and common mass of evidence
      give birth to a universal concord of opinions and of hearts.
