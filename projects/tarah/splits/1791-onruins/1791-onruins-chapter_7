      CHAPTER VII.
    

      PRINCIPLES OF SOCIETY.
    

      Wandering in the woods and on the banks of rivers in pursuit of game and
      fish, the first men, beset with dangers, assailed by enemies, tormented by
      hunger, by reptiles, by ravenous beasts, felt their own individual
      weakness; and, urged by a common need of safety, and a reciprocal
      sentiment of like evils, they united their resources and their strength;
      and when one incurred a danger, many aided and succored him; when one
      wanted subsistence, another shared his food with him. Thus men associated
      to secure their existence, to augment their powers, to protect their
      enjoyments; and self-love thus became the principle of society.
    

      Instructed afterwards by the experience of various and repeated accidents,
      by the fatigues of a wandering life, by the distress of frequent scarcity,
      men reasoned with themselves and said:
    

      "Why consume our days in seeking scattered fruits from a parsimonious
      soil? why exhaust ourselves in pursuing prey which eludes us in the woods
      or waters? why not collect under our hands the animals that nourish us?
      why not apply our cares in multiplying and preserving them? We will feed
      on their increase, be clothed in their skins, and live exempt from the
      fatigues of the day and solicitude for the morrow."
    

      And men, aiding one another, seized the nimble goat, the timid sheep; they
      tamed the patient camel, the fierce bull, the impetuous horse; and,
      applauding their own industry, they sat down in the joy of their souls,
      and began to taste repose and comfort: and self-love, the principle of all
      reasoning, became the incitement to every art, and every enjoyment.
    

      When, therefore, men could pass long days in leisure, and in communication
      of their thoughts, they began to contemplate the earth, the heavens, and
      their own existence as objects of curiosity and reflection; they remarked
      the course of the seasons, the action of the elements, the properties of
      fruits and plants; and applied their thoughts to the multiplication of
      their enjoyments. And in some countries, having observed that certain
      seeds contained a wholesome nourishment in a small volume, convenient for
      transportation and preservation, they imitated the process of nature; they
      confided to the earth rice, barley, and corn, which multiplied to the full
      measure of their hope; and having found the means of obtaining within a
      small compass and without removal, plentiful subsistence and durable
      stores, they established themselves in fixed habitations; they built
      houses, villages, and towns; formed societies and nations; and self-love
      produced all the developments of genius and of power.
    

      Thus by the aid of his own faculties, man has raised himself to the
      astonishing height of his present fortune. Too happy if, observing
      scrupulously the law of his being, he had faithfully fulfilled its only
      and true object! But, by a fatal imprudence, sometimes mistaking,
      sometimes transgressing its limits, he has launched forth into a labyrinth
      of errors and misfortunes; and self-love, sometimes unruly, sometimes
      blind, became a principle fruitful in calamities.
