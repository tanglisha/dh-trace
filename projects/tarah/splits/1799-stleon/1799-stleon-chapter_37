In my conference with the bashaw I may seem to have
secured more than one point of material importance;[393]
yet it was difficult for any man to be in a state less consolatory
or more full of danger and menace, than I was at
this moment. By my vigilance and the power which thus
I had acquired, I prevented indeed the inhabitants from
wantonly destroying the means of their own subsistence;
but, the more I was their benefactor, the more I appeared
to become odious to their thoughts. My negotiation with
the bashaw, whatever other benefit might accrue from it,
did not tend to increase the resources of the country; I was
obliged to witness many scenes of wretchedness. He that
would assist mankind in their adversity, must harden his
heart to be the spectator of the distress that he can, and that
he cannot, relieve. But whatever I beheld of this sort, the
majority of the bystanders obstinately persisted to ascribe
to my deliberate malignity. The military aid I found myself
necessitated to introduce by no means tended to disarm
the prejudices of my clients. In one or two instances, but
no more, slight tumults arose, and a few of the rioters fell
a prey to their own wickedness and folly. These misfortunes
were cast as reproach upon me; and I was pursued
with clamours and curses. I found it requisite to obtain a
guard for my person. I was abhorred by those for whom
all my vigilance was exerted, and insulted by the mouths
that I supplied with the necessaries of existence.
Nor was this my only source of alarm and uneasiness in
my present situation. I was by no means a dupe to the
ostentatious civility of the bashaw. I perfectly understood
his insinuation when he invited the frequent repetition of
my visits. I knew that, however dearly I purchased his
friendship and patronage, I should still have to purchase
them again and again. His extortions upon me admitted
of no limits, except from his own modesty, or the estimate
he might form of my invisible resources. Bribery itself
afforded me no complete security; and, now that I had become
an object of curiosity and remark, he had sufficiently
shown me I was at the mercy of his caprice, or that of his
master, for my liberty, and even for my life.
Yet, could I have resolved to quit Hungary, and seek
the protection of some more regular government, what benefit
should I derive from a removal? Mystery was the great[394]
and unconquerable bane of my situation, and from the poisonous
influence of mystery, the most regular system of
government was not competent to protect me. It would be
idle to imagine that, in any country on earth, a stranger
would be permitted to launch into such expenses as those
in which I was engaged, without becoming an object of
suspicion, and being made liable to continual interruption
in his measures. Yet, unless allowed to use the resources
I possessed, of what advantage was it to be the depository
of wealth without a bound? Was it to be wished for a
man under my circumstances, to have a family, or to be
without a family? When I had one, I found the legacy of
the stranger robbing me of every comfort of that sort, with
the most calamitous aggravations. When I was stripped
of wife and children, though no man could prize those benefits
more dearly than I prized them, I took to myself the
consolation, that at least now I should risk no oneâ€™s happiness
but my own; and that, for a person exercising my
endowments, it was perhaps requisite to be free from every
shackle and incumbrance. I found however the topic from
which I had consoled myself, in reality the source of a new
misfortune. I had the wealth of a nobleman; but I was
deprived of his adventitious attributes. I had no illustrious
ancestry to boast; I had neither lineage nor parent; I had
neither wife nor children, in whom mutually to reflect and
see reflected the elevatedness and generosity of my station.
I had not even the ordinary advantage, which is within the
reach of almost every man, of connections and acquaintance,
friends handed down to me as a branch of my patrimonial
inheritance, friends whose value experience enabled
me to ascertain, and friends with whom long habits of familiarity
had given birth to reciprocal endearment. The
bashaw had imputed to me the design of forming a party.
Alas! these, which are the great materials for cementing
party attachments, were totally denied me. I had no bonds
of alliance but those which money afforded, the coarsest, the
meanest, the least flattering, and the most brittle of those
ligatures, that afford the semblance of uniting man with
man.
