I had now continued here for several months, and in all
that time had received no external impressions but such as
related to the cell I inhabited, and the misanthropical savage
by whom it was visited. One evening that Bethlem Gabor
entered my dungeon, I observed in him an air of unusual
disturbance. Where apathy reigns, the intercourse between
those over whom it presides will be marked with a death-like
uniformity; but wherever the furious passions take
their turn, they will occasionally subside into a semblance
of familiarity and benevolence. There was something in
the countenance of my tyrant that made me for a moment
forget the complicated injuries I had received from him.
“What is it that has disturbed you?” cried I. There was
no answer. There was a knitting in his brow, and a contraction
in his features, that showed me his silence was an
effort. He departed however, and had already passed the
threshold of my dungeon. The door was in his hand. He
returned. “Chatillon,” said he, “perhaps you will never
see me more!”
“My castle is besieged. I have passed through dangers
of a thousand names, and I ought not to be made serious
by that which now assails me. But a gloomy presentiment
hangs upon my mind. The busy phantom of life has
lasted too long, and I am sick at heart. In the worst event
I will not be made a prisoner; I will die fighting.
“I feel as if this were the last day of my existence; and,
upon the brink of the grave, animosity and ferociousness[427]
die away in my soul. In this solemn moment, my original
character returns here (striking his heart) to take possession
of its native home; a character, stern and serious, if you
will; but not sanguinary, not cruel, not treacherous or unjust.
Between you and me there is a deadly antipathy;
but you did not make yourself; you intended me friendship
and advantage; the sufferings you have experienced from
me in return have been sufficiently severe. If I die defending
my walls, and you remain thus, you will perish
with hunger. I had intended it should be so; but I am
now willing to remit this part of your fate. I will enter
into a compromise with you; I will trust to your fidelity,
and your honour. I will take off your chains; I will
bring you a timepiece and torches; I will leave with you
the key of the spring lock of your cavern,—provided you
will engage your word to me that you will not attempt to
make use of your advantages till the expiration of twenty-four
hours.”
To these terms I assented without hesitation. The chains
fell from my wrists and my ancles; I stood up once more
unshackled, and in respect of my limbs a free man. When
Bethlem Gabor was on the point to depart, my soul melted
within me. I took hold of his hand; my fingers trembled;
I grasped and pressed the fingers of my tyrant. I cannot
describe what then passed in my bosom. No man can
understand my sensations, who had not been in my situation,
who had not passed through a treatment, arbitrary,
ferocious, and inhuman, and had not then seen the being
who had wounded him so unpardonably, suddenly changing
his character, commiserating his fate, and rescuing him
from destruction.
From this time I saw Bethlem Gabor no more; he died,
as he had sworn to do, in the last dike of his fortress.
His self-balanced and mighty soul could not submit to the
condition of a prisoner; he was nothing, if he were not
free as the air, and wild as the winds. I may be mistaken;
but this appears to me to have been a great and
admirable man. He had within him all the ingredients of
sublimity; and surely the ingredients of sublimity are the
materials of heroic virtue. I have much cause of complaint[428]
against him; he conceived towards me an animosity
the most barbarous and unprovoked; but, in writing this
narrative, I have placed my pride in controlling the suggestions
of resentment, and I have endeavoured to do him
justice.
I had engaged to wait twenty-four hours; I waited only
six. I know not how the reader will decide upon the morality
of my conduct; but I own I had not the force, I believe
I may call it the insensibility, to remain in my dungeon
any longer. There was no doubt that, if Bethlem Gabor
returned a conqueror, the term of my imprisonment would
be renewed, and all his former menaces continued in force.
What should I deserve to have thought of me, if I could
sit down idly, and tamely wait the return of my jailor?
No! liberty is one of the rights that I put on when I put
on the form of a man, and no event is of power to dissolve
or abdicate that right. Of what validity was the promise
that Bethlem Gabor extorted from me by compulsion, and
as the condition of that which he had no title to withhold?
What gratitude did I owe to this man, who treated me with
every contumely, and shrunk from nothing but the thought
of causing me to perish with hunger? Whatever became
of my attempt to escape, I could at least in this vast subterranean
hide myself from the face of him who had injured
me. I had a provision of phosphorus in my chest;
and could therefore extinguish my torch upon the slightest
alarm, and relume it at pleasure. What was the value of
life, situated as I was situated? It was better to perish in
the attempt to escape, than linger on for ever in perpetual
imprisonment. As a further resource I left a billet in my
dungeon (for for this also I had implements) intreating
Bethlem Gabor by every motive of compassion and humanity
to provide for me the means of sustenance as usual.
Having taken these precautions, I lighted a fresh torch;
and, unlocking the door, and thrusting the key into my
girdle, set out upon my expedition. Though Bethlem
Gabor had stipulated for twenty-four hours, the siege might
even now be over, and I trembled every instant lest my
jailor should return.
I wandered for a considerable time among the alleys and[429]
windings of this immeasurable cavern. I had the precaution
to mark the sides of the vault with characters and
tokens as I passed, that, if necessary, I might be able to
find the way back to my dungeon: this might prove an
indispensable resource, to prevent me from perishing with
hunger. Once or twice I changed my route, inferring
from a comparison of circumstances, the best I could make,
that I was not in the direction of the castle from which
Bethlem Gabor had led me to my imprisonment. In all
this wandering I had seen nothing, I had heard nothing,
which could demonstrate to me that I was approaching the
habitation of man. I had groped my way for near two
hours, when on a sudden I heard a loud and tremendous
shout that almost stunned me, and that from its uncommon
shock could be at no great distance from the place
where I stood. This was succeeded by a terrifying glare
of light. I extinguished my torch, both that I might be
better qualified to observe, and that I might be less in
danger of discovery by any one who should approach me
unawares. The shouts were several times repeated. The
light I found to proceed from that end of the vault towards
which I had been advancing, and, by the best conjectures I
could form, I concluded the outlet into the castle to be at
no great distance. I heard the crackling of the flames,
and the fall of rafters and beams. Presently I discerned a
volume of smoke approaching me, and found that, if I remained
long in my present station, I should incur the risk
of being suffocated. I formed my resolution. I concluded
that Bethlem Gabor’s castle was taken, and set on fire by
the Austrians. I believed that my persecutor was already
no more: to this faith I was undoubtedly prompted by the
presentiment which he had communicated to me. I saw
that it would be impossible for me to emerge into light, till
the flames should abate. I once more therefore lighted
my torch, and returned by the straightest road I could find
to my dungeon. Arrived there, I proposed to pass the
interval quietly, in the cavern where I had so long felt the
weight of the Hungarian’s chains. Suddenly however the
suggestion occurred to me, may not my conjectures be
false? may not Bethlem Gabor yet repel the enemy, and[430]
return to me from amidst the ruins of his falling castle?
The thought was sickness and extinction to my heart.
Hope! beautiful as are thy visions, in how much anguish
and agony do they clothe the terrors of disappointment!
Never had Bethlem Gabor been half so dreadful to me as
now. I shrunk away; I took with me the fragments
of provision that yet remained; I hid myself; I deemed
no cell remote enough to conceal me from the inhuman
persecution of my tyrant.
I continued in the subterranean all that day and all the
succeeding night. Once in this period I attempted to reconnoitre
the avenue of my escape, but I found the situation
still so heated and suffocating that I did not venture to
proceed. At length I came forth from this den of horrors,
and again beheld the light of the sun. The path had
already been sufficiently explored by me, and I no longer
found any material obstacles. I now saw that my conjectures
were true: the castle of my ferocious adversary was
a pile of ruins. The walls indeed for the most part remained,
but choked with fragments of the falling edifice,
blackened with the flames, and penetrated in every direction
by the light of day. With difficulty I climbed over
the ruins, which opposed my egress from the subterranean,
and rendered my passage to the outside of the castle an
affair of peril and caution. Here the first object that
struck me was some tents, probably of the soldiers who
had been employed in this work of destruction. I was
hailed by a sentinel, and I demanded that he would conduct
me to his commander. He led me to the centre of
the little encampment, and I stood in the presence of his
chief. I lifted my eye to behold him, and was petrified
with such astonishment as till that hour I had never felt.
It was Charles, my son, my only son, the darling of his
mother, the idol of my soul!
