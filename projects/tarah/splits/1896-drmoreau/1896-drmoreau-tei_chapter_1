INTRODUCTION.

On February the First 1887, the Lady Vain was lost by collision with a
derelict when about the latitude 1° S. and longitude 107° W.


On January the Fifth, 1888—that is eleven months and four days
after—my uncle, Edward Prendick, a private gentleman, who certainly went
aboard the Lady Vain at Callao, and who had been considered drowned, was
picked up in latitude 5° 3′ S. and longitude 101° W. in a small
open boat of which the name was illegible, but which is supposed to have
belonged to the missing schooner Ipecacuanha. He gave such a strange
account of himself that he was supposed demented. Subsequently he alleged that
his mind was a blank from the moment of his escape from the Lady Vain.
His case was discussed among psychologists at the time as a curious instance of
the lapse of memory consequent upon physical and mental stress. The following
narrative was found among his papers by the undersigned, his nephew and heir,
but unaccompanied by any definite request for publication.


The only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was picked up is
Noble’s Isle, a small volcanic islet and uninhabited. It was visited in
1891 by H. M. S. Scorpion. A party of sailors then landed, but found
nothing living thereon except certain curious white moths, some hogs and
rabbits, and some rather peculiar rats. So that this narrative is without
confirmation in its most essential particular. With that understood, there
seems no harm in putting this strange story before the public in accordance, as
I believe, with my uncle’s intentions. There is at least this much in its
behalf: my uncle passed out of human knowledge about latitude 5° S. and
longitude 105° E., and reappeared in the same part of the ocean after a
space of eleven months. In some way he must have lived during the interval. And
it seems that a schooner called the Ipecacuanha with a drunken captain,
John Davies, did start from Africa with a puma and certain other animals aboard
in January, 1887, that the vessel was well known at several ports in the South
Pacific, and that it finally disappeared from those seas (with a considerable
amount of copra aboard), sailing to its unknown fate from Bayna in December,
1887, a date that tallies entirely with my uncle’s story.
